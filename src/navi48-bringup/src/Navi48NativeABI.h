/*
 * Navi48NativeABI.h - the user-client ABI of the native stack (kext 0.0.601, native step S1c; ABI 1.1 scanout selectors added in 0.0.603; ABI 1.2 DAL experiment selector added in 0.0.604; ABI 1.3 timed mode-trial selector added in 0.0.605; ABI 1.4 grows its result and adds the resync / OTG-lock rows in 0.0.606; ABI 1.5 (0.0.607) enables row 120 behind navi48-row120=1 and reports the clock hold in the result's reserved words).
 *
 * ONE plain-C header shared by three consumers: the kext (Navi48NativeClient), the Mesa Darwin backend
 * (copied byte for byte to mesa-mac/include/darwin/navi48_native_abi.h) and the PC test tools
 * (tools/native/n48native.c, s1d_replay.c). The contract is notes/design/NATIVE-S1C-ABI.md: where this
 * file and the contract disagree, the contract wins (and this file is the bug).
 *
 * Transport: IOServiceOpen(svc, task, N48N_UC_TYPE, &conn), then IOConnectCallMethod(conn, selector, ...).
 * Scalars are uint64_t, at most 16 each way. Every struct input is at most 4096 bytes and arrives inline.
 * Every reserved field must be 0. Little-endian, natural alignment, no packing.
 * CPU map of a BO: IOConnectMapMemory64(conn, memoryType = BO handle, ...).
 *
 * Only stdint.h is needed; the same text compiles as C11 and as C++11.

/* ---- ABI 1.3: the timed mode trial (kext 0.0.605, native S2d) --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ABI 1.3 addendum (proposed text for notes/design/NATIVE-S1C-ABI.md; the header is the only place it lives until the reviewer merges it):
 *   Selector 16 N48N_SEL_MODE_TRIAL. Native boots only (navi48-native=1 with S1b POSITIVE PASS), scanout plane NOT acquired, DISPCLK/DPPCLK at least what the row's DML
 *   needs (read from the DFS registers, never assumed), the live mode the 60 Hz census raster. It programs the display to the row's refresh (row 50 = the 60 Hz raster at a
 *   201 MHz pixel clock, 49.90 Hz, the live 60 Hz DLG/TTU stays; row 120 = 497.75 MHz, 2720x1525, the DML DLG/TTU/prefetch goldens; row 120 needs a passed row-50 trial on
 *   the same boot), verifies the OTG frame rate over 3 s (within 1 %), DIO_FIFO_ERROR / DIO_ERROR_COUNT unchanged and the DP stream still enabled, holds `dwell`, then restores
 *   EVERY register it wrote to the copy taken before any write this boot (reverse order) and verifies the 60 Hz rate is back. A watchdog thread restores if the trial thread
 *   has not reached its restore by settle + measure + dwell + 2 s. After any failure verdict a sticky latch refuses every further trial until the next boot.
 *   PASS needs the restore transition to be clean too: DIO_FIFO_ERROR 0, DIO_ERROR_COUNT not grown across the restore, DP1_DP_STEER_FIFO bit 4 clear, DIG1_DIG_FIFO_CTRL0 bits 29:28 clear.
 *   Row 120 is hard-denied (N48N_MODE_D_ROW120_OFF) in 0.0.605. The DAL step and the trial refuse each other.
 *   Time in the trial mode is about 0.5 s + 3 s + dwell. The hardware writes are the ones listed in navi48_modetrial_tables.h (the generated golden tables), nothing else.
 *   It never raises a clock: a row whose DML clocks exceed the live DFS readback is DENIED (n48dal / navi48-dalsmc is the only clock path).
 *   n48n_mode_result: verdict N48N_MODE_V_*, deny N48N_MODE_D_* (verdict DENIED: nothing was written), flags N48N_MODE_F_*. Tool: tools/native/n48mode.c.
 * ABI 1.4 addendum (kext 0.0.606, native S2-120HZ; design notes/design/NATIVE-S2-120HZ.md P1 / P2 / P3):
 *   The result is 512 B: the first 256 B are the 1.3 layout unchanged, the second 256 B are `ext` (below). A client built for 1.3 must not call selector 16 on a 1.4 kext (the output size differs).
 *   Two new rows, both at 60 Hz with no clock or DTO change: row 1 = the DP1 stream resync (blank, then unblank, exactly Linux's order: field-exact writes of DP1_DP_VID_STREAM_CNTL,
 *   DP1_DP_STEER_FIFO and DIG1_DIG_FIFO_CTRL0 only; one retry; the stream is left blanked only if both attempts failed, and then the restore / watchdog / `dcnmode 0` / kext stop unblank it);
 *   row 2 = OTG0_OTG_V_TOTAL 1481 -> 1501 lines (expected 59.15 Hz) inside that resync, under the OTG master update lock (optc3_lock / optc1_unlock), DRR double-buffer mode 2 (start of
 *   frame) written before the lock and restored to its golden value last; the latch is confirmed by the pending bits and by OTG0_OTG_STATUS_POSITION.VERT_COUNT exceeding the old maximum.
 *   flags word (in[2]): N48N_MODE_TF_RESYNC wraps a row-50 trial's writes and its restore in the same resync. Row 2 and the TF_RESYNC row-50 trial need a passed row-1 resync on this boot.
 *   The underflow registers (HUBP0_DCHUBP_CNTL, ODM0_OPTC_INPUT_GLOBAL_CONTROL) are read before the trial (must be clean), after the settle (reported), every 250 ms during the rate window and
 *   the dwell (an underflow ends the trial: verdict UNDERFLOW, restored, latched) and after the restore (an underflow there makes the verdict RESTORE). They are cleared with their write-1
 *   strobes (never while ODM0_OPTC_INPUT_GLOBAL_CONTROL.INPUT_SOFT_RESET is set). Row 120 stays hard-denied. */
/* ABI 1.5 addendum (kext 0.0.607, native S2-120HZ; design notes/design/NATIVE-S2-120HZ.md P4 / P5):
 *   Row 120 (2560x1440, 2720x1525, 497.75 MHz = 119.998 Hz) is DENIED (N48N_MODE_D_ROW120_OFF) unless the boot-arg navi48-row120=1 is present. With it, the trial needs: a native boot with S1b POSITIVE PASS and
 *   navi48-dalsmc=4; E1b (n48dal e1b) run on THIS boot; a passed row-50 trial, a passed row-1 resync and a row-2 PASS with N48N_MODE_F_LOCK_HELD_PROVEN on THIS boot (deny 15 / 23); the F6 / F7 / P1 baselines
 *   (OTG lock usable, FIFO health, underflow clean); the clock hold available (deny 22: the reason is ext.hold_pre, n48dal::HoldPre 1 level, 2 no E1b, 3 DAL latch, 4 hold state, 5 mailbox owner busy). The operator keeps the
 *   display awake (rdna4-nosleep or caffeinate -d): display sleep would race the DP1 blank.
 *   Sequence: (1) clock hold: DISPCLK then DPPCLK SetHardMinByFreq 530 MHz (each acknowledged and reported done), the DFS readback must reach 514.285 / 500.000 MHz; (2) DP1 blank; (3) DRR mode 2 then the OTG master update lock;
 *   (4) the OTG timing / global-sync / VTG / HUBP DLG-TTU registers (recorded, then written); (5) unlock, wait for the pending bits, V_TOTAL latch witness; (6) DP_DTO0 (the pixel clock moves AFTER the unlock);
 *   (7) DP1 MSA timing; (8) DP1 unblank; (9) settle 500 ms; (10) rate window 3 s (119.998 Hz +/- 1 %, underflow 0, DIO growth 0, steer / DIG clean, stream active, DFS >= need, sampled every 250 ms); (11) dwell;
 *   (12) THE restore: DTO first, then lock / OTG + HUBP reverse / unlock / pending / latch witness, then MSA, DRR mode, unblank (any failing wait continues and sets the restore bad); (13) verify the 60 Hz rate, stream, health,
 *   underflow; (14) only then release the clock hold (DPPCLK then DISPCLK to the 272 MHz floor). A restore that did not verify never releases (hold state STUCK: the clocks stay up, harmless at 60 Hz; cold power cycle).
 *   Any failure at any step goes to the restore. The watchdog restores registers only; it never touches a clock. New words: verdict 12 CLOCK_LOST (the DFS readback fell under the need while held), verdict 15 HOLD (the release
 *   did not verify), flags 22..24, the hold report in ext (hold_*). The result struct keeps its 512 B; the hold report lives in what 1.4 called ext.reserved. */
/* ABI 1.7 addendum (kext 0.0.609, native S2 milestone #8: the cube at 120 Hz; design: the "0.0.609" section of notes/design/NATIVE-S2-120HZ.md and the comments of dcn/navi48_modetrial_pure.h):
 *   A mode trial and a scanout client exclude each other (scanAcquire refuses while a trial is busy; the trial refuses while the plane is acquired). The HELD mode lets a scanout client present WHILE the display runs at 1440p 120 Hz.
 *   Selector 17 N48N_SEL_MODE_HOLD (row 120 only, needs everything `n48mode 120` needs): runs the SAME trial on a kernel thread - deny gate, clock hold, blank, lock, writes, unlock, latch, DTO, MSA, unblank, 500 ms settle, the
 *   3 s judged rate window - and, when that is clean (no failure, rate inside 1 %, no underflow judged), does NOT dwell for a fixed time: it publishes the entry snapshot and returns it (verdict N48N_MODE_V_HELD) with the mode UP.
 *   Otherwise the caller gets the trial's ordinary result (DENIED, or a failure that has already been restored and latched). While HELD (busy stays 1: no other trial or DAL step can start) ScanoutAcquire is allowed - and
 *   only for the owning session, or for a HANDOFF hold's next session - with the live plane geometry check unchanged (row 120 writes no viewport / pitch / format register).
 *   The hold ENDS on: ModeRelease (selector 18, any session); the owning session's close or death; the max hold time in[0] (1000..300000 ms, 0 = 120000; the watchdog deadline counts from the first write and is that plus 12.5 s); a HANDOFF hold's 30 s with no
 *   taker; `dcnmode 0` or the kext stop (verdict ABORT, latched); a failure seen by the sampler (every 250 ms: HUBP / OPTC underflow, DIO FIFO error or count growth, DP stream, steer / DIG FIFO, the DFS readback under the need)
 *   or by the frame-counter stall detector (that verdict, restored, latched); the watchdog (a stalled hold thread: verdict WATCHDOG). EVERY end runs the same sequence, in this order: (1) `ending` (no further Acquire), the scanout
 *   plane is put back to the console and that restore is VERIFIED (the client's next Present answers NotReady); (2) the timing restore of the trial (DTO first, lock, OTG + HUBP registers, unlock, pending, latch witness, MSA,
 *   DRR, unblank; the blanked-transition underflow is recorded and cleared as in 0.0.608); (3) the 60 Hz rate, stream, FIFO health and underflow are verified; (4) only then the clock hold is released (it never releases on a bad
 *   restore, including a scanout put-back that did not verify: verdict RESTORE, hold_flags SCAN_BAD).
 *   Ownership: a native session is EXCLUSIVE, so the tool that starts a hold and the scanout client cannot be open together. in[1] = N48N_HOLD_F_HANDOFF makes the hold survive the close of the issuing session and passes it to the
 *   next session that ScanoutAcquires (which then owns it: its close ends the hold); without HANDOFF the issuing session owns the hold and its close ends it. `n48mode hold120 --run CMD` uses HANDOFF: it holds, closes, runs CMD,
 *   re-opens and calls MODE_RELEASE, which returns the FINAL result (immediately when CMD's own close already ended the hold). The result's hold_end says why it ended (N48N_HOLD_END_*), hold_flags what happened (N48N_HOLD_FL_*).
 *   Selector 18 N48N_SEL_MODE_RELEASE: ends a running hold and waits (<= ~30 s) for the whole end sequence, returning the final result; with N48N_REL_F_QUERY it only reports (the entry snapshot while held, else the last final
 *   result); DENIED (deny 25) when no hold ran this boot. The two selectors take no client lock. Lock order: see the comment above `gMt` in dcn/navi48_dcn.cpp.
 *   A refresh-rate note for clients: nothing in the scanout path assumes 60 Hz (the storm guard is 1000 IRQs / s, the idle watchdog 5 s, the restore polls 200 x 1 ms); ScanoutQuery reports the live rate from the DP DTO and the OTG totals. */
