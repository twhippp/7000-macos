// gfx_mmprio.h — 0.0.433 (notes/design/MM-PRIORITY.md). MM-WINDOW PRIORITY, THE PURE DECISION LOGIC.
//
// decide36b measured single-IB policy runs at 19.25 ms/run, with descriptor reads alone 11.7 ms/run
// (60.7% of it) — and 0.0.433's design memo established that cost is ~99% WAITING for gVramMmLock, not reading
// (uncontended, the same reads cost about 0.1 ms). The most likely contender is our OWN residency copier, which
// pushed 492 MiB through the same MM window that boot, releasing and re-taking the lock every 64 dwords
// (Navi48AccelPeer.cpp:1297-1312). This header is the fix's PURE half: which thread should back off, for how long,
// and whether it rode the bound out. The reader itself (gfxc_read, gfxc_page, gfxsrc_desc_read, n48_dp_read,
// gfxsrc_pgm_profile, xlat12) is untouched — this only changes who gets gVramMmLock first.
//
// Pure C++ (static inline), so the kext and its host suite (tests/gfx_mmprio_test.cpp) run the SAME arithmetic.
// Nothing here takes a lock, calls IODelay or reads the clock: every function is handed scalars the caller already
// has — a thread identity as `uintptr_t` so this header needs no kernel headers, and elapsed microseconds already
// computed from clock_get_uptime by the caller. THE INSTRUMENT IS ALWAYS ON; the switch (`accel gfxneuter 37`) only
// gates whether a non-owner thread actually yields — the owner's own lock wait is timed unconditionally, so the
// `mmprio:` report line is an honest A/B whichever way the switch is thrown.
