// hybrid_policy.h — build 0.0.503 (notes/design/HYBRID.md and step H1): WHO MAY OPEN THE ACCELERATOR.
// Pure C, host-tested by tests/gfx_copyguard_test.cpp section T22 (with planted breaks); the kext compiles the SAME header.
//
// THE HYBRID. WindowServer composites on the GPU; every other process draws on the CPU. The door every Metal, GL, 2D and
// video client passes is the accelerator's IOGraphicsAccelerator2::newUserClient (static 0x145bfe02, vtable slot 239),
// which Navi48AccelPeer.cpp swaps on OUR per-instance copy of the accelerator's vtable (ucp_hook_new_user_client). With
// switch 68 ON the hook refuses every task that is not WindowServer, with kIOReturnNotPermitted and *handler NULL,
// BEFORE Apple's function is called; Metal's device creation then returns nil (HYBRID.md.1, CONFIRMED from bytes).
//
// THE IDENTITY (HYBRID.md.2): the calling process's name is exactly "WindowServer" (ws_ident.h's N48_WS_OWNER, the
// owner rule the rest of the kext uses) AND its uid is 88 (_windowserver). A name alone is not an identity (any process
// can call itself WindowServer); a uid alone is not either. No name (unknown caller) is never WindowServer.
//
// SWITCH 68, DEFAULT OFF. `gfxneuter 68 | M << 8`: M 1 ON (= 324), M 2 OFF (= 580, the default and the boot value), bare
// `68` reads and changes nothing. OFF, n48_hy_decide ADMITS every caller: the hook calls Apple exactly as before. The
// switch is changed only while NO arm stands (n48_hy_switch_refused, one-shot or continuous); the kext reads it ONCE per
// newUserClient call (a latch), and that one value feeds both the decision and the counters.
//
// Clients opened before 68 goes ON stay admitted (nothing here closes them): they are counted as `others_off`, the
// pre-existing figure the H1 run compares `others_on` (which must stay 0) against.
