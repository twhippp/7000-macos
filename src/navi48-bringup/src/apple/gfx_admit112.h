/* gfx_admit112.h - build 0.0.554 (; notes/design/ADMIT-STALE-112.md): SWITCH 112 "admit112", ADMIT STALE.
 *
 * `112 | M << 8`: M 1 ON (= 368), M 2 OFF (= 624, the default and the boot value), M 3 SHADOW (= 880); bare `112` reads. INERT unless
 * switches 10, 11, 18, 21 and 45 are ALL ON (nothing is fed, nothing is asked, the callback is not wired). The verb refuses 112 ON
 * while 103 is ON, and 103 ON while 112 is ON; the callback is not wired while 103 is ON in any of its own modes' ON.
 * 0.0.555 (the 0.0.554 review): a copy / lin EVER entry is admitted only when EVERY page of its recorded extent walks to its VRAM
 * (n48_ad_extent_walk, as resprov's ask does); a lapsed precondition WIPES the ledger (n48_ad_precond_gate: frame top, the ask, the
 * feeds); the drops compact in one pass; 112 ON and 110 ON refuse each other at the verbs.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. PROVENANCE REFUSED (xlat12 status 29, err_op 0xF7) is decided in ONE place that this switch touches: d_table_desc's image
 * loop (xlat12_ib.c), after every proof ask (ledger, resprov, frame-local) said no. That refusal protects CONTENT only (a texture read
 * whose bytes we cannot prove are the ones we wrote), and only for a TILED record; a DCC record is a layout question and is NEVER
 * admitted. ON admits a tiled, NOT-DCC, table-path record of an ALLOW-LISTED program (X, AN, U, BC, AF, BD: store-free, texels cannot
 * become addresses - ADMIT-STALE-112.md section 1, CONFIRMED on the objects) when its page resolves through the asking frame's VM and the
 * EVER-WRITTEN GUARD holds: this arm's own ledger of surfaces a committed frame or a recorded residency copy demonstrably wrote,
 * matched on (context, VA, mode, base page). `ok = proven || admitted` and every later rung still runs. SHADOW evaluates the SAME
 * question, counts it and returns 0, so its output is OFF's.
 *
 * THE EVER LEDGER (static, EVER_MAX entries, arm-scoped). FED ONLY: (1) at the committed-frame ledger feed, from the entries that
 * feed just wrote (src LEDGER); (2) at resprov RECORD, from a copy that RECORDED (src COPY, or LIN for a backing-sourced one). An
 * unrecorded copy, a neutered frame, a compute write and a CB1-7 target never feed it. DROPPED: on an unmapVA by range (the ledger's own
 * two-sided rule, fail closed), on a WindowServer drop or rebind, on an arm change, and WHOLE when an unmap event was lost. NEVER
 * cleared by the descriptor epoch, by switch 58's un-feed or by switch 109's eviction: that is the point of it. Oldest evicted, counted.
 *
 * Pure: no lock, no clock, no log. Host-tested by tests/gfx_admit112_test.cpp; the translator's half by src/xlat12/tests. */
