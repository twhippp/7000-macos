/* gfx_cp_build.h — 0.0.393: THE CONSUMER LIST'S THREE LOOPS, IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS. Through 0.0.392 the consumer's pointer list was built by three loops inside
 * AppleHardwareHook.cpp's gfxsrc_policy, and tests/gfx_dep_test.cpp carried a SECOND copy of those loops ("the mirror").
 * measured the cost of that arrangement: the mirror was pinned only to four source strings, so replacing the real
 * fail-open `if (!fixed[q]) { gXpIn.over = 1u; continue; }` with `if (!fixed[q]) { continue; }` left the mirror's 476
 * checks passing, 0 failed. A test that no mutation of the REAL code can break is not testing the real code.
 *
 * THE FIX, AND IT IS THE FIRST OF THE TWO NAMES: move the loops into a header the kext calls once. There is now ONE
 * copy - this file - and it is compiled into both the kext (AppleHardwareHook.cpp) and the host suite (gfx_dep_test.cpp
 * includes it). The three loops, the `over` expression and the `ptr_inherit` carry are byte for byte 0.0.392's; moving
 * them changes no output, no counter, and no verdict.
 *
 * C++ ONLY (the value-initialisation below), and deliberately NOT included by gfx_dep.h: gfx_dep.h is also compiled as C
 * by src/xlat12/xlat12_ib.c, and this header depends on xlat12_ib.h. Only the two C++ call sites include it.

/* 0.0.421 (notes/design/MIB-COMMIT.md H4) — THE FRAME'S READ-SET IS THE UNION OF EVERY SEGMENT'S.
 *
 * THE HAZARD. The kext captures the consumer list per SEGMENT (`n48_cp_build_consumer(&gXpIn, &ds)` inside the
 * policy's segment loop), and through 0.0.420 the gate read whatever `gXpIn` the LAST segment left. A multi-segment
 * frame was therefore judged on its last segment's reads only: an input an EARLY segment binds — and a held-back
 * frame may have left unwritten — was invisible to R1-R4. Every committed frame to date is one segment, so the
 * fail-open has never fired; MIB (multi-IB) and R1's three-segment producers are the first multi-segment commits.
 *
 * THE FIX, and the two properties it is built on. This merges ONE segment's list INTO the frame's accumulator:
 *
 *   1. SINGLE-SEGMENT IDENTITY. On a zeroed accumulator the merge appends every input and every pointer in the
 *      same order the builder produced them, and copies the same four scalars, so the result is FIELD FOR FIELD the
 *      one segment's own consumer. A one-segment frame is therefore judged exactly as 0.0.420 judged it — the
 *      existing suites are the proof.
 *   2. NOTHING IS EVER REMOVED. It does not dedupe: a page named by two segments is asked about twice, which can
 *      only make the rule refuse more, never less. That is also why the fixed heap page the builder already names
 *      twice stays named twice (the reason N48_CP_PTR_MAX was RAISED, NOT DEDUPED).
 *
 * A segment whose list did not fit, or whose programs' ABI was unknown, carries `over`; an accumulator any segment
 * sets `over` on is INCOMPLETE and n48_cp_eval answers N48_CP_LIST_OVER. Appending past either cap sets `over` for
 * the same reason. A segment the caller could not enumerate at all is not passed here; the kext marks the
 * accumulator UNPROVEN for it (see AppleHardwareHook.cpp's segment feed), which is the fail-closed direction.
 *
 * Parameter names are `dst`/`seg`, NOT `c`, on purpose: gfx_dep_test.cpp pins that every use of the consumer's pointer
 * array in this header is the builder's own store, so a read of the union's source array must not be counted as one. */

/* 0.0.406 — THE INPUT-FREE FILL CONSUMER, BUILT UNDER THE SAME ONE-COPY RULE AS THE LOOPS ABOVE.: a
 * `ws_B_ColorFill` carries no descriptor table, so it never runs the table step, so `ds.in_abi` is 0 and the builder above
 * is never called for it - and the fill then falls to `n48_dep_check`'s `source_neuters` rung, which is >= 1 from f3 on
 * every measured boot, so only f1 ever commits. This builder is the second shape: the frame is input-free EXACTLY when
 *
 *     nseg == 1  AND  the in-force PS identity is ws_B_ColorFill  AND  the translator saw no descriptor table
 *                AND  no image reads  AND  its single pointer page is named (the PS_2/3 colour pointer, AFTER any
 *                fill-colour retarget)  AND  the bound context's root[511] is already WRITTEN (the sixth condition)
 *
 * and then it is enumerated with ZERO image inputs and ONE pointer page. The single pointer page is where the fail-closed
 * edge is: without a named VA there is no page to resolve, so this refuses and the frame stays on 0.0.389's path.
 *
 * Why the retarget VA and not Apple's original: measured the pair as a plain 64-bit VA of a 16-byte float4 that
 * `ws_B_ColorFill` LOADS, and the kext can only NAME that VA when the retarget wrote it (`ds.fill_color_new`, our
 * arena). An untargeted fill's pointer VA is not exported by the translator anywhere else, so this builder is handed 0 and
 * declines - fail-closed, never a guessed page. OFF (switch 33), the kext never calls this and `enumerated` stays 0.
 *
 * THE SIXTH CONDITION (0.0.407). root[511] - the page table entry that makes the arena pointer page
 * resolvable at all - is written by the KEYSTONE INSIDE THE FIRST COMMIT, after translation. So on the first fill (f1)
 * the named pointer page CANNOT resolve: if the fill were enumerated input-free there, R3 would refuse it `R3-pointer-page`,
 * it would be retired, root[511] would never be written, and every later fill would refuse the same way -'s mistake
 * exactly, re-introduced through the R3 page instead of the verb gate. `root_written` is the kext's own reading of that
 * state (`gfxsrc_fillcolor_root_written`), and requiring it here means f1 falls through to 0.0.389's rung (source_neuters
 * 0 before it) and COMMITS as arm22 did, so the keystone writes root[511] and the twin fill is then enumerated and clean.
 * It is a POSITIVE condition: a caller that cannot answer it passes 0 and the frame stays off this path.
 *
 * 0.0.438 (FINDING 4 INTERIM REFUSAL; notes/design/D4-PRIME.md Finding 4) — `draws` is the frame's ONE
 * segment's own draw count (xlat12_draw_stats.draws, `nseg == 1` already requires exactly one). A segment's translate
 * exports only its LAST draw's inputs, and this builder's whole premise is that the frame reads NOTHING beyond the
 * one named pointer page - a premise a GPUPass-then-ColorFill segment (or any other multi-draw segment whose last
 * draw happens to bind the fill program) would silently violate, because the EARLIER draw's own reads were never
 * exported at all. Refusing whenever `draws != 1` keeps this builder fail-closed until D4' lands: a single-draw
 * fill segment (every committed fill measured so far, per notes/design/D4-PRIME.md) is unchanged.
 *
 * Returns 1 when the consumer was built, 0 (leaving `*c` zeroed) otherwise. Pure; the kext and the host suite compile the
 * SAME function. */

 * makes it host-testable: gfx_dep_test.cpp's shape runs this exact routing, not a copy of it.
 *
 * `resolve`/`resolveCtx` mirror the kext's own `gfxc_page(vm, va, ...)` call, abstracted to a plain callback so this
 * stays pure; `vmOk` is the caller's own `vm.ok` (a page walk with no live page table cannot resolve anything, the
 * SAME fail-closed reading the inline code gave it). Skips every walk when the union is already `over` or was never
 * enumerated (a pure clause below has already refused it - the same "no walk for a row already refused" discipline
 * R1 (gfx_memdst.h) applies). `mdEnforce`/`mdOk` are the SAME R1 discharge the table-ABI consumer's own rung takes
 * (notes/design/R1-MEMDST.md Q2 item C): under R1 ENFORCE with a clean memory-destination scan, R4's wait/write
 * refusal is redundant and is discharged for the D4' consumer exactly as it already is for the table-ABI one.
 *
 * THE ROUTING (D4-PRIME-FIXES.md item 2's own name, "a declined union keeps today's rung"):
 *   - COMPLETE (`enumerated == 1 && over == 0`): judged for real - `clause` is n48_cp_eval_hz_d4's own answer,
 *     `*enumForRung` 1 (this frame speaks for the CPROV identity, N48_DEP_ID_CPROV).
 *   - OVER, WITH a table segment present this frame (`hasTableSeg`, the caller's own `gXpInFrame == judged + 1`):
 *     `clause` LIST_OVER, `*enumForRung` 1 - 0.0.438's OWN answer for a frame the table path could not enumerate
 *     either; D4' does not WORSEN that frame's verdict, it only WIDENS coverage to frames the table path never
 *     touches at all.
 *   - OVER, WITHOUT a table segment: `clause` NOT_ENUM, `*unproven` 1, `*enumForRung` 0 - a frame neither path can
 *     prove is UNKNOWN to the CPROV identity rather than a wrong answer, so the dep rung falls through to
 *     `source_neuters` (gfx_dep.h's own older rung) instead of refusing on a union this build could not build.
 *
 * `overAttr` (build 0.0.494, switch 61 latched): 1 makes the OVER-with-table-segment branch name its count (1)
 * instead of 0. 0 is 0.0.493's routing exactly.
 *
 * `ccD4` is mutated in place (its own `resolved`/`ptr_resolved`/`ptr_page`, and `waits`/`memwrites` under the R1
 * discharge) - the caller passes its own file-scope accumulator, exactly as the inline code operated on it directly. */
