// gfx_heapgen.h — build 0.0.495 (: RUN D's hang). THE SHADER-HEAP COPY / SUBSTITUTION RACE, PURE HALF.
//
// WHAT RUN D SHOWED (driverlog-stream.txt of run10i, in this order): the gate answered COMMIT for token seq 12 (an ordinary
// green fill whose programs were judged `all-programs-ours`); then `COPIED #62 ... bytes=0x9000 -> VRAM [0x10020000,0x10029000)
// ... GPU VA 0x400028000` rewrote WindowServer's shader heap with Apple's gfx10 bytes; then the RING EXEMPTION spared seq 12;
// and only AFTER that did the shader cache re-apply our gfx1201 programs (`SUBSTITUTED ... GPUPass[fragment] ... at resource
// +0x2300` and 30 more). The CP ran f23 over gfx10 code and the GPU hung. The residency copy (Navi48AccelPeer.cpp
// residency_copy_to_vram) writes Apple's bytes FIRST and substitutes AFTER (shadercache_scan_resource), on the copier's own
// thread with no lock shared with the submit path; the program memo (gfx_src_decide.h) revalidates one dword only at verdict
// time. So between the copy's first write and the substitution's last one, VRAM holds gfx10 code at an address a committed
// frame was told is ours.
//
// SWITCH 62 (default OFF) closes it two ways, both of which live on top of this header:
//   1. SUBSTITUTE IN THE COPY (the primary fix). Before the copy's first VRAM write, the copier scans the SAME backing bytes
//      with the SAME shader-cache scan and verification (sc_scan_window's key + byte compare, sc_subst_render's capacity
//      check) that the post-copy substitution runs, and records each program it would substitute as a PATCH: the resource
//      offset, the rendered length and the rendered bytes. The write loop then overlays those bytes onto each 256-byte batch
//      it read from the backing, BEFORE the batch is written (n48_hg_overlay). VRAM therefore never holds Apple's gfx10
//      bytes at a substituted program's address, not even transiently: the bytes the copy writes there ARE ours.
//      WHY IT CANNOT WRITE OUTSIDE THE PROGRAM'S EXTENT: n48_hg_overlay changes only the bytes of the batch buffer that lie in
//      [p.off, p.off + p.nb) - the patch's own range, which is exactly the range the post-copy substitution writes today (the
//      same render, the same `nb`, bounded by the entry's capacity) - and the batch buffer's destination is the copy's own
//      pre-flighted VRAM range, unchanged. It never extends a batch, never adds a write, never moves one.
//   2. A HEAP GENERATION COUNTER (the backstop). A copy that overlaps any substituted program (it carries a patch or a
//      poisoned program, or its destination overlaps a VRAM range a substitution has ever written) bumps `gen` when it
//      STARTS (before its first write) and again when its substitution COMPLETES (the copy scope's close, after the post-copy
//      substitution and kernsub): odd = in progress. `active` counts such copies, so two concurrent copies cannot make `gen`
//      look even while one of them is still writing. The judged frame records `gen`/`active` BEFORE it reads any program
//      (n48_hg_frame_begin); the commit (gfxsrc_commit_try's `live`) and the ring exemption (gfx_neuter.h's heap_refuse) both
//      refuse the frame when anything moved (n48_hg_judge). A program that could not be patched in the copy - or a copy that
//      failed or did not read back clean - is POISONED by GPU VA, and every frame that names a program in a poisoned range is
//      refused until a later overlapping copy completes cleanly.
//
// build 0.0.496 (the review of 0.0.495), two fixes, both of switch 62's ON behaviour only:
//   F4 THE OVERLAY RE-CHECK (n48_hg_overlay_checked). The pre-scan matched Apple's program at the patch's offset in the backing
//      as it read then; the write loop reads the backing again, batch by batch. Before a batch is overlaid, the batch's backing
//      bytes over the matched Apple program's range [p.off, p.off + p.apple_nb) must still equal the bytes the pre-scan matched
//      (kept in the copy's apple arena). A patch whose bytes differ is marked BAD: it is not overlaid in this batch nor in any
//      later one, the copier POISONS the program's range and the copy completes UNCLEAN (fail-closed). A patch with no recorded
//      Apple bytes (apple_nb 0) cannot be re-checked: the copier poisons it at the pre-scan instead of patching it.
//   F1 THE REGISTRY PRUNES AND NEVER SATURATES ON A NORMAL RUN (n48_hg_reg_add, n48_hg_reg_prune). 0.0.495's registry only grew;
//      RUN C (run10h) reached 133 distinct substituted ranges - every one of them still live at the end (8 heaps; each heap's last
//      patched copy re-substitutes its whole union) - so it saturated and every later copy counted as overlapping. Now: (a) a
//      copy that completes CLEAN with NO patch and NO poisoned program, while it is the only overlapping copy in progress,
//      removes every registry range it fully covers that no substitution touched since it began (each entry carries the
//      registry's add/touch sequence); a range a patched copy (re)registered after the pruning copy began, or while another
//      overlapping copy is in progress, is never removed; (b) a new range arriving when the registry is FULL is merged into
//      the hull of the nearest entry within N48_HG_REG_MERGE_GAP (a superset: more copies overlap, never fewer) instead of
//      setting reg_over; reg_over (every copy overlaps) remains only for a range with no entry that close.
//
// Pure C that compiles as C++; no heap, no libc beyond memcpy; the kext compiles THIS header, and tests/gfx_copyguard_test.cpp
// drives the same functions with RUN D's real order (section T18) and, 0.0.496, RUN C's real registry sequence (section T20).

//     for the pass, sets `pending` in the SAME gHgLock section as the judge (tentative: seq 0, the committing thread, the time).
//     The gate's record stamps the frame's token seq (hg_commit_record), or clears it when the gate did not commit. The ring walk
//     (hg_exempt_refuse) clears it in the SAME gHgLock section as its own judge, after it (spared OR refused). Every exit of the
//     commit hook clears the committing thread's flag (keystone withdrawal, token mismatch, the NOPed or un-walked frame's
//     teardown); a disarm (the one-shot's finish, `gfxneuter 5`, 72 OFF) clears it; a flag older than N48_HG_PEND_EXPIRE_US is

//: the start-up voids were fills the walk NOPed for heap-gen - a residency copy started after the fill's judge and before its
// walk. (the design's corrections): 0.0.511's wait ended at the WALK, so a waiting copy then landed while the spared frame
// ran (the F4-BAD gap,); and the ring sees a retirement only at a judged frame or switch 65's expiry poll, while the waiting
// copier holds accel+0x88 (every submit takes it) - so THE COPIER READS THE FLIGHT'S FENCE ITSELF. Two phases:
//   PRE  (judge -> EXIT 3): as 0.0.511's flag, but the walk does NOT clear it under M3 (n48_hg_pend_clear refuses WALK), so it holds
//        from the walk to the hook's EXIT 3 with no gap. Set only in the start-up window (`startup`, latched at the judge).
//   LIVE (EXIT 3 SPARED with a fence -> the fence reads `want`): the copier waits for it (any bumping copy, patched or not), reading
//        the fence slot with gHgLock RELEASED. Ended by: the copier's read (RET_COPIER), the judged-frame poll (RET_POLL), switch
//        65's expiry poll (RET_EXPIRY), the flight's own expiry (FLIGHT_EXPIRED), the copier's 100 ms bound (TIMEOUT_LIVE, a
//        FINDING: the copy then writes under a possibly running frame), or a 2 s age (LIVE_AGE, == kKsFlightUs). Never by exits
