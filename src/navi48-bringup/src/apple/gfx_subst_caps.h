// gfx_subst_caps.h — build 0.0.484 (notes/design/GLASS.md Q2 K1-K7, Q6). THE PROGRAM AND IMAGE LIMITS OF THE
// SOURCE HOOK'S PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION, IN ONE PLACE, AND THE PURE HALF OF WHAT THEY SIZE.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. glass_background_lph (BD 0x597b70b28759e040, BE 0x5abbb918af0075b7) blocks the login screen's
// frames at program-unknown ("key 0"). Its gfx1201 images are 5084 B (BD, 1271 dwords) and 5076 B (BE, 1269), which fit
// Apple's own 5376-byte allocation; but a substitution writes max(ours, Apple's) bytes, so ANY glass image renders to
// 5376 B, and four separate limits stood between that image and a frame (GLASS.md Q2's table):
//   K1 kScMaxSubstBytes (Navi48AccelPeer.cpp, gScOut): the residency writer's output buffer. sc_subst_render refuses
//      SC_E_CAPACITY when it is smaller than the write, so at 2048 glass was never substituted at all.
//   K2 kXdSubstBytes (AppleHardwareHook.cpp): one row of the recognition pool gfxsrc_xlat_open renders every
//      substitutable image into. At 2048 the glass image lands in `tooBig` and can never be recognised as OURS.
//   K3 kXdPgmDwords (AppleHardwareHook.cpp): gfxsrc_read_program's second read. Our gfx1201 bytes carry no gfx10
//      terminator, so recognition reads the FULL window and needs got * 4 >= the image's bytes: 1344 dwords.
//   K4 N48_PGMID_CAP (gfx_pgmid.h): the head-first identity read (switch 38 modes T/T+M), >= 1271.
// Each lived as a literal beside its own buffer, with nothing tying them together; GLASS.md K6 found that raising K4
// alone would read past gXdPgm. The constants now live HERE, AppleHardwareHook.cpp and Navi48AccelPeer.cpp take their
// own names from them, and the static_asserts below make the dangerous combinations fail to compile - in the kext AND
// in every host test that includes this header.
//
// THE PURE HALF (the same code the kext runs, so the host suites test it rather than a copy):
//   n48_xd_read_program - gfxsrc_read_program's two-step read (the rest of the page, then the full K3 window when no
//                         gfx10 terminator was in it), over a caller-supplied reader.
//   n48_xd_ours_find    - "are these bytes one of OUR rendered images?", the byte compare both the identification
//                         (gfxsrc_identify_pgm) and the no-identity witness (gfxsrc_note_no_identity) run.
// The pool BUILD (which needs the shader-cache library) is gfx_subst_pool.h.
