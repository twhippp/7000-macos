// rootwrite_guards.h — the G1..G6 refusal predicate for MILESTONE 3 step 4
// increment (iii): the single 8-byte root PDE write into a live Apple VM context.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, DEPENDENCY-FREE HEADER.
//
// notes/M3-ROOT-WRITE-REVIEW.md.4 divides the guards sharply:
//
//     G1-G3 fail SILENTLY and OFF-TARGET  (another process's GPU memory, no fault)
//     G4-G6 fail LOUDLY and ON-TARGET     (a clean VM fault at an address we chose)
//
// A guard whose failure is silent cannot be validated by running it on hardware and
// seeing nothing happen — "nothing happened" is exactly what a silently-wrong guard
// looks like. So the predicate is a PURE FUNCTION over an explicit input struct,
// with no kernel types, no globals and no I/O, and the host test
// tests/rootwrite_guards_test.cpp drives it through every REFUSAL path. The kext
// and the test compile the identical code: there is no second implementation to
// drift.
//
// The rule this encodes: an identity may key ONLY on something Apple
// cannot recycle underneath it. Apple reuses AMDHWVMContext addresses (r86) AND
// AMDAccelTask addresses (r87), sometimes in the same boot, so the vtable and task
// checks are used ONLY TO REJECT, never to confirm; what confirms is our own
// creation sequence number, which is ours and monotonic.
//
// Returns 0 (kRootWriteOk) to permit the write, else the number of the FIRST guard
// that refused. Guards are evaluated in order so the reported number is the
// earliest objection, which is the most informative one.

// r93 refused to arm because root[511] already held exactly the PDE it was about to
// write: our own entry from r92, which no teardown ever withdrew and which survived
// the reboot because VRAM is not zeroed and the carve is deterministic. G4 was right
// to refuse, and the tempting exemption - "permit it when the slot already equals what
// we would write" - stays REJECTED: our L1 address is stable across boots, so that
// value is predictable and a different client's recycled page could legitimately hold
// it.
//
// notes/M3-ENTRY-LIFETIME.md replaces it with a question that is decidable rather
// than probabilistic: does this entry's ADDRESS FIELD name a page inside the region
// THIS BOOT reserved? Three structural facts make that proof of ownership:
//   * Apple's page-table blocks come only from its own arena (mapVMPT's allocator,
//     isInVMReservedPool's +0x4400000 bound);
//   * Apple's client pages come only from vram_alloc_hi, which our carve sits above
//     and which navi48_vram_apple_dest_check refuses for our region;
//   * our reservation lies in the 188 MiB gap between them, with 64 MiB of clearance.
// So an entry naming our tail cannot be Apple's: it is ours, or stale bytes. Both are
// safe to overwrite. This is the same argument G3 already trusts in the opposite
// direction ("a target INSIDE the arena").
//
// HOOK PATH ONLY. The mapVA arm fires on the zero -> non-zero transition, which means
// Apple's lazy allocator handed this page to this context inside that very call - so
// the page is provably a freshly allocated root block, not another client's live leaf.
// That evidence does not exist at the `rootwrite` verb, whose target selection merely
// picks a live context agreeing with CONTEXT2. `armTransition` carries it, and without
// it this predicate always refuses.
