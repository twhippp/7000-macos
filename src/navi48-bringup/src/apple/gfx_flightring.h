// gfx_flightring.h — C5 part 1 (0.0.443, notes/design/C5-CONTINUOUS.md Q1 "For N flights"): THE FLIGHT RING.
// Pure C, host-tested by tests/gfx_flightring_test.cpp (with planted defects); the kext compiles the SAME header.
// DEFAULT-INERT in the sense every other X-header here is: a zero-initialised ring is sixteen FREE entries, and
// every function below answers the empty/off case first.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS —'s hazard, generalised past ONE flight
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Through 0.0.442 there was ONE kstone flight record (`gKsFlight`), stamped by every commit at the gate BEFORE the
// keystone runs. At budget > 1 a second candidate B overwrote the record of a committed frame A that might still be
// executing; 0.0.430 CLEARED it on B's refusal and let hook_unmapVA WITHDRAW root[511] under A (the arm3/arm10 class,
// ); 0.0.431 fixed it by STASHING the outgoing record at the stamp and RESTORING it on a matching refusal
// (`n48_ks_flight_save` / `n48_ks_flight_restore_ok`, still in gfx_keystone.h and still exercised by that header's own
// interleaving model). That fix works for exactly ONE flight at a time being clobbered by exactly ONE later stamp.
//
// This build replaces the single record with a RING of up to N48_FR_CAPACITY flights, each independent. A keystone
// refusal now frees ONLY the entry the refused commit itself pushed (item 2 of the brief) — nothing else in the ring
// is touched, so the stash/restore dance is no longer needed for the kext's own use (the pure save/restore helpers
// stay in gfx_keystone.h, unused by the kext from this build on, because gfx_keystone_test.cpp's own H2 interleaving
// model still drives them independently of anything here).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FIVE STATES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   FREE       the slot holds no flight. The boot-time zero value.
//   PENDING    pushed at the GATE STAMP — the same instant 0.0.442 wrote `gKsFlight.active = 1`, BEFORE the keystone
//              runs. This preserves KEYSTONE-A-PRIME's ordering (notes/design/KEYSTONE-A-PRIME.md, "A′'s order: stamp
//              before the marker read"): an unmap that races in between the stamp and the keystone's decision must
//              still see this flight as live and defer, exactly as it did when the single record's `active` bit was
//              set at the same instant.
//   COMMITTED  the keystone proved the frame will run (n48_fr_mark_committed). In flight; may still retire by its own
//              fence or expire by its own timeout.
//   NOT_RUN    reached from COMMITTED (the ring-walk exemption refused the frame AFTER the keystone permitted it —
//              the IB was NOPed and never reached the CP) OR, since 0.0.444 (C5-RING-REVIEW.md (B) item 4), from
//              PENDING (a TOKEN MISMATCH at the hook: the entry's own flight preserved A′'s ordering and must stay
//              live rather than being freed, matching 0.0.442's timing — see n48_fr_mark_not_run). Either way it
//              is still deferred to its own bound — nothing will ever write its fence slot, so a poll can never
//              retire it, and it can end only by the timeout (0.0.444: or by EXPIRED, below). It must NEVER be
//              read as retired (item 1's "never counted as retirement"): n48_fr_poll_entry refuses to retire
//              anything but a COMMITTED entry.
//   RETIRED    this entry's OWN owned-slot fence read OURS (n48_fr_poll_entry). Terminal for the DECISION: never
//              re-armed, never polled again, never counted as live. Reclaimable (0.0.444, below).
//   EXPIRED    (0.0.444, item 6) a live entry whose own age passed the withdrawal bound (n48_fr_expire), asked the
//              same question n48_fr_defer_verdict already asks per entry. Terminal for the DECISION, exactly as
//              RETIRED is, but it names "we gave up waiting" apart from "we saw it finish" for a report. Reclaimable.
//
// A keystone REFUSAL frees a PENDING entry back to FREE (n48_fr_free_by_seq) — the entry never ran, so there is
// nothing left for it to protect. 0.0.444 (item 6): RETIRED and EXPIRED entries are RECLAIMED back to FREE
// (n48_fr_reclaim) once their terminal state has been observed, because the ring's capacity (16) is NOT far above a
// future continuous arm's spend rate (switch 41, the NEXT build) the way it is above this build's own one-shot
// ceiling (N48_CM_SHOT_BUDGET_MAX = 4) — without reclamation a long-running arm hits RING-FULL at its 16th commit
// and never recovers. `newestSeq`/`newestRetired` on the ring itself (item 7) are what let a decision still answer
// NOW_EOP for "the newest flight retired" AFTER its slot has been reclaimed and no longer holds that evidence.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE WITHDRAWAL DECISION (item 4) — "ANY entry live and within its bound" DEFERS; EVERY entry ended WITHDRAWS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// n48_fr_defer_verdict asks, of every entry still PENDING/COMMITTED/NOT_RUN ("live"), the same clock question
// gfx_keystone.h's n48_ksd_eval asks of its one flight — is `now_us - at_us >= timeout_us`? — and combines them with
// a FOR-ALL: withdrawal is permitted only once every live entry has expired ITS OWN bound (or retired by its own
// fence, which excludes it from "live" entirely). One entry still within its bound defers the whole decision,
// exactly as item 4 asks. At exactly one live entry this reduces field for field to n48_ksd_eval's own answer — the
// budget-1 identity the brief requires — and gfx_flightring_test.cpp proves it by driving both functions on the same
// fixture and comparing n48_ksd_defer() of each.
//
// A torn stamp (`at_us == 0` on a live entry, or `now_us` before it) fails the WHOLE ring closed to N48_KSD_NOW_TORN,
// the same direction n48_ksd_eval takes for its one flight — TORN does not defer, it falls back to 0.0.383's
// unconditional withdraw/re-arm. This is the one place a single entry's anomaly can affect the others, and it is
// deliberate: `at_us` comes from the same monotonic clock every push and every decision reads, so a live entry whose
// own stamp is impossible is a sign the clock or a store is not to be trusted for ANY entry this instant, not just
// its own — exactly the class of doubt n48_ksd_eval already treats as ground for falling back to the pre-deferral
// behaviour rather than defer past it. It cannot make withdrawal happen EARLIER than today for a legitimately
// tracked entry: it degrades the *system*, not one entry's evidence, to the same safe floor 0.0.383 always had.
//
// A RETIRED entry answers "not in flight" wherever it would once have answered "end of pipe observed": both are the
// SAME point in gfx_keystone.h's own enum (n48_ksd_defer is 0 for both N48_KSD_NOW_EOP and N48_KSD_NOW_NOT_IN_FLIGHT),
// so the defer/withdraw DECISION is identical either way; only the reported reason NAME can differ, and it is
// reported honestly (a retired entry really is no longer in flight).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// OUT-OF-ORDER (item 5) — RECORDED ONLY IN THIS BUILD
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// n48_fr_out_of_order asks, the instant an entry retires, whether any entry with an EARLIER ordinal is still live
// (not yet retired). It answers a question, nothing more: this build does not stop on it, count it against a safety
// gate, or change any decision because of it. The NEXT build (switch 41, continuous mode) makes it a stop condition.

 * so the compiler cannot cache a stale value across the loop this header's own functions run. The KEXT is
 * responsible for the fence discipline at the two boundaries, exactly as it always was for gKsFlight: a
 * `__ATOMIC_RELEASE` thread fence after every write that publishes a NEW value of `state` (the push, and every
 * later transition), and ONE `__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE` thread fence in hook_unmapVA BEFORE it calls n48_fr_defer_verdict
 * (covering every entry's `state` and `at_us` that call goes on to read, rather than one fence per entry — simpler,
 * and strictly more conservative). This header's own functions run single-threaded (the writer side is always the
 * one commit-path thread, serialised by the kext's own gXdLock, exactly as gKsFlight's writer always was) and never
 * need the fences themselves; only the kext's cross-thread reader does, at its own call site.

/* =====================================================================================================================
 * build 0.0.498 ( RUN H, RUN H2) — SWITCH 65: END OF PIPE, ASKED AT THE DEFERRAL'S EXPIRY.
 * The ring's retirement test (n48_fr_poll_entry against the entry's OWN owned-slot fence) runs only at a JUDGED FRAME,
 * so a commit landing just before WindowServer's ~5 s pause was still COMMITTED when the next unmap arrived after the
 * pause: n48_fr_defer_verdict answered NOW_TIMEOUT, hook_unmapVA withdrew while the ring still showed the flight live,
 * and the continuous arm stopped (stop_why 3) although the GPU had finished (the retirement came at the next judged
 * frame, ~40 log lines later). With switch 65 ON the kext asks THIS function at that NOW_TIMEOUT, before anything is
 * decided from it: every COMMITTED, fenced entry that is past its own bound (the entries that made the verdict
 * TIMEOUT) has its owned slot read ONCE through the caller's `rd` (the same MM-window read the judged-frame poll
 * performs) and is fed to the SAME n48_fr_poll_entry - so it retires ONLY on its own exact epoch|ordinal value, in
 * ordinal order (n48_fr_next_poll), exactly as a judged frame would retire it. The caller then re-asks
 * n48_fr_defer_verdict; if nothing live remains the answer is NOW_EOP and the withdrawal that follows is the ordinary
 * end-of-pipe one (withdrawnWhileLive does not move). Anything that did not read OURS stays COMMITTED, the verdict
 * stays TIMEOUT and the withdrawal is exactly today's (fail-closed).
 *   OFF (`on` 0): returns 0 before reading anything - no `rd` call, no ring byte touched (the OFF identity).
 *   Entries still within their bound are NOT read (they cannot have made the verdict TIMEOUT; a judged frame polls them).
 *   PENDING / NOT_RUN / fence-less entries are never read and never retire (n48_fr_next_poll's own filter).
 *   `ret[0..cap)` receives each retirement (seq, ordinal, value, the entry's own at_us, and n48_fr_out_of_order asked the
 *   instant it retired); the return value is the number retired. `o` (optional) gets the per-call counts.
 * Writes only the ring's own bookkeeping (n48_fr_poll_entry's state/newest/polls/retired). The caller must serialise it
 * against the judged-frame poll (the kext holds gXdLock, try-locked, around it). */
