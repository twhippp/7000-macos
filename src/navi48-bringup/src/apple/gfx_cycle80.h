// gfx_cycle80.h — build 0.0.525 (notes/design/CYCLE80.md): CYCLE COMPLETENESS, SWITCH 80.
// `80 | M << 8`: M 1 ON (= 336), M 2 OFF (= 592, the default and the boot value), M 3 SHADOW (= 848), bare `80` reads.
//
// THE RULE (CYCLE80.md C1-C7). WindowServer double-buffers two LAYERS (run11c: X 0x400800000, X' 0x404800000); each cycle's frames
// write one layer and the cycle's P (the 1040-dword final display pass) samples it into a plane. Switch 73 copies a plane only
// when its P COMMITTED; that says nothing about the frames that painted the layer the P sampled (: the avatar's frame 'a'
// refused while d, b and P committed: a picture WindowServer never produced reached the glass). With 80 ON a COMMITTED P's
// present is held unless its cycle was COMPLETE: every frame that wrote the P's layer since that layer's previous P committed.
//   C1 THE TABLE: N48_C80_LAYERS layers keyed by (ctx, physical base page) - the hazard's identity - never evicted, cleared when
//      80 turns ON; per layer va, extent, state (UNKNOWN / CLEAN / DIRTY) and the counts since its last P (writers, committed
//      writers, held-back writes, unknowns); a N48_C80_RING-entry ring {seq, layer mask} of the frames committed at the gate.
//      Everything here is written under gXdLock; the two things that happen outside it (a writer lost after the gate, a frame
//      the judge never saw) are QUEUED lock-free and drained at the next judged frame's top (n48_c80_drain).
//   C2 A P: a single-IB 1040-dword frame with ONE colour target that is NOT a known layer. Its layer is its D draw's one tiled
//      input (cyc515's in_layer/in_ok), resolved to a physical page through the P's own vm - BY CONTENT, never by the
//      descriptor slot (`dslot` below is an instrument the kext cannot fill today; T10 proves the key never reads it). No
//      input, an input that does not resolve, or a full table: UNDETERMINED (held). A 1040-dword frame whose target IS a
//      layer is a WRITER.
//   C3 WRITERS: a judged frame's colour targets are matched with each layer's base page, or (same ctx) by VA inside [va,
//      va + extent). Committed at the gate: a committed writer (and ring). Held back (the R5′ note site): READABLE - every
//      layer whose base page equals a target page or whose range holds a target or memory-destination VA gets a held-back
//      write; BLIND, targets truncated, no R5′ record (28 OFF), or a frame never judged: EVERY layer gets an unknown;
//      BOUNDED: nothing.
//      0.0.525 BUILD FINDING (deviation from CYCLE80.md C3, in the fail-closed direction): the R5′ record's colour targets are
//      each CB slot's LAST base per IB (gfx_capture_scan.h n48_gcap_scan_ex emits cbBase[] once, after the walk), so a frame
//      that draws a layer and then retargets CB0 never names the layer - run11c F67 ('b', refused) and F70 (refused) wrote X
//      and X' and their R5′ records do not show it, and P69 / P74 read COMPLETE (a fail-OPEN). So every judged frame's
//      colour targets are ALSO cyc515's write set for the same frame (gfx_cycle515.h: EVERY CB/DB base any IB sets, gCy515.ws),
//      matched by VA: a held-back frame's layers are the UNION; a held-back frame whose cyc515 set is not known gives every
//      layer an unknown. It only ever ADDS held-back writes ( MEDIUM-1: the instrument never opens anything): a committed
//      frame is credited from the gate's own target list alone, as the contract says.
//   C4 LOST AFTER THE GATE: the ring's layers of that seq get an unknown and every P slot on those layers whose seq is newer is
//      DEMOTED to INCOMPLETE (a demotion of a slot already COMMITTED - a copy may have been made - is counted). A seq not in the
//      ring: every layer.
//   C5 THE P's JUDGEMENT, at its gate, BEFORE anything resets: DIRTY if any held-back write or unknown since the layer's last P;
//      else CLEAN if at least one committed writer; else the state is UNCHANGED (sticky). Only then are the counts zeroed. A
//      committed writer of L that reads another layer M that is not CLEAN (or whose reads are not known) gets an unknown.
//   C6 (gfx_present73.h n48_p73_c80_hold) the present holds a COMMITTED P unless 80 judged THAT P COMPLETE; before Part E.
//   C7 A layer starts UNKNOWN (pre-arm, pre-discovery): the glass waits for its first complete cycle.
//   X1 SHADOW computes, counts and logs exactly as ON; only the present's hold is not applied (it counts "would hold").
//
// Pure: no lock, no clock, no register, no log. Host-tested by tests/gfx_cycle80_test.cpp over run11c's real sequence.
