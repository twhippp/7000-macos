// gfx_sk82.h — build 0.0.527 (notes/design/SKIP82.md): SWITCH 82, SKIP A BYTE-IDENTICAL RESIDENCY
// RE-COPY. THE PURE HALF: the write counters' arithmetic, the invalidation event ring, the entry table, the skip decision, the
// establishment and the log/report formats. No register, no page table, nothing of Apple's; plain C that also compiles as C++,
// __atomic builtins only, no libc beyond stdint (the gfx_copyguard.h convention). Compiled into the kext (Navi48Bringup.cpp owns
// the storage and the lock; Navi48AccelPeer.cpp calls it from the copier) and into tests/gfx_sk82_test.cpp.
//
// THE SELECTOR: `gfxneuter 82 | M << 8`: M1 MEASURE (338) compares and counts, never skips and never forces a full verify; M2 OFF
// (594, the default and the boot value); M3 SKIP (850). Bare 82 reads. Any other M is refused unchanged (st 11).
//
// THE INVARIANT a skip rests on: VRAM [vram, vram + bytes) still holds exactly the entry's stored image. It holds from the
// ESTABLISHMENT (a copy that wrote every byte and read every dword back equal, with nothing else of ours or of the GPU able to have
// written that range between the copy's G0 and the check) until any of:
//   - one of OUR writes touches the range: every write opens a copy-guard scope (navi48_cg_open, the single choke point,
//     fact 3), which bumps the range's 64 KiB bucket counters AFTER its slot (or the untracked count) is published open and
//     before its first write - so a write in progress is always visible as either an open slot or a moved counter (D1 below);
//   - an unmapVA overlapping the entry's VA (any context: a superset of the (context, VA) rule), a WindowServer drop, a context
//     release, a binding or arm-level change (the snapshot), a committed frame (the gate), a client IB the ring walk did not NOP
//     (GFX writeTail), or any Apple SDMA ring submission: these are EVENTS in a lock-free ring drained under the table's lock;
//     every event but the unmap clears ALL entries (the unknown-write rule: shader stores are not enumerated anywhere);
//   - a poison row over the range, an open or untracked scope, a switch or state snapshot change.
// A skip re-checks all of it (slots, then counters, then poison, then a final drain) after a FULL memcmp of the source against
// the stored image. Any doubt copies as today.
//
// DEVIATION D1 (from SKIP82.md item 3, reported to the reviewer): the contract bumps each bucket ONCE in navi48_cg_open BEFORE
// n48_cg_slot_open. A writer that has bumped but not yet published its slot is then invisible to both halves of a check: its bump
// is already inside the baseline, and its slot is not open yet. tests/gfx_sk82_test.cpp S7 found the schedule: the bump before our
// G0, the slot and the write between a later skip's slot scan and its counter read -> a skip over rewritten VRAM. Bumping AFTER
// the slot is published open closes it (a writer that bumped has an open slot until its close; one that has not bumped has not
// written), and keeps the contract's "+1 per bucket (our own open)" at establishment. Reader orders: G0 reads counters THEN
// slots; the establishment and the skip read slots THEN counters (S7 walks every schedule of a foreign writer's four steps).
