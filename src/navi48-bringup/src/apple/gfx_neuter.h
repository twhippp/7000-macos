/* ---- 0.0.279: the neuter AT THE SOURCE ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * wsneuter1 showed a frame can reach the CP before the writeTail hook runs, so a rewrite of the ring can lose.
 * AMDGFX10PM4GraphicsChannel::commitIndirectCommandBuffer @0xbe20a00 (vtable slot 95, 25G83) builds each GFX frame directly
 * in the ring block (getRingBlock be20a65, memcpy of the 128-dword template be20a87), writes one INDIRECT_BUFFER packet per
 * IB entry, commits the block and submits. Its IB-list loop skips an entry whose first dword is 0 (be20bab-be20baf
 * `movl (%rax),%edi; testl %edi,%edi; je`), leaving the template's 0xFFFF1000 padding (the template is NOP-filled at
 * be21161) - so zeroing the entries' first dwords BEFORE calling the original means the IB packet never exists in the ring.
 * AMD_SUBMIT_COMMAND_BUFFER_INFO as that function reads it:
 *   +0x00 u32 flags: 0x2 -> timestamp-only frame, 0x10 -> single-IB frame (no length check), neither -> the IB-list frame
 *   +0x04 u32 low 4 bits = VMID (be20bde),  +0x14 u32 IB count (be20b91),  +0x18 u32 stamp (be20a56)
 *   IB entry i at +0x4c + 0x28*i: +0x00 u32 length|flags (be20bab), +0x0c u64 VA (be20bba)
 * The packet for entry i lands at template dword 0x2d + 4*i (be20ba2: +0xc0, header at -0xc); room for 4 before the

 * notes/M4-X9-COMPLETE.md, CONFIRMED in 6 of 6 runs: SecurityAgent's Metal frame is VMID 3. n48_gfxsrc_check above
 * returns N48_SRC_NOT_VMID2 for it, the hook handed it to Apple untouched, and the ring walk recorded only `vmid == 2`
 * INDIRECT_BUFFERs, so its gfx10 IB (`00190000 00000004 03000e90`) reached the CP, which parked ON that packet
 * (CP_RB0_RPTR 0x62d = frame 0x600 + 0x2d) in every one of those runs. Two changes, both DROP-ONLY:
 *   1. THE SOURCE (n48_gfxsrc_route): a frame of exactly the shape the source neuter is proven on (IB-list, 1..4 IBs, every
 *      template slot still Apple's padding) on another VMID is classed OTHER_VMID and NEUTERED. It is routed around the
 *      decision entirely, so it can never be translated: the set of frames that reach the decision (and so the only frames
 *      COMMIT could ever pass) is byte-for-byte n48_gfxsrc_check's N48_SRC_OK set, unchanged.
 *   2. THE RING (n48_gfxn_walk): every count-2 INDIRECT_BUFFER of ANY VMID is recorded for the ring NOP, VMID 2 in its own
 *      list exactly as before and every other VMID in a second list, so no VMID-2 position the old walk recorded can be
 *      displaced by another VMID's. It is the backstop for every shape the source still passes (not an IB-list frame, count,
 *      template).
 * The frozen copies of the old logic and the planted defects (the old VMID-2-only filters) are in tests/gfx_neuter_test.cpp.
 * 0.0.362: layer 1 is now keyed on WindowServer's OWNER, not on VMID 2 (n48_gfxsrc_route_owner below; the
 * 0.0.358-0.0.361 route is frozen in the test). Layer 2, the ring walk, is unchanged: it NOPs IBs of every VMID either way. */

 * is as an input - `is_ws`, ws_identity's answer (ws_ident.h: exactly one live context owned by a living WindowServer, whose
 * root is the page-table base of THIS frame's VMID, on the VMID recorded for it) - and the VMID number decides nothing:

 * PER-IB: `gRd.ibsArmed` counts every IB the walk found, and the RING_NOP identity (gfx_dep.h) books a spared IB in

 * `SPARED ? 1u : 0u`, so a spared 2-IB frame left IB 1 unaccounted: the frame was still handed to gfx_neuter_frame as
 * `found 1` with an EMPTY position list (n48_gfxn_nop_list returns nothing for a mib spare), which booked `over = 1`
 * into gGn.overCap and then N48_DEP_GFX_ESCAPED. This helper is the count both places must use: the frame's whole nib
 * when it is a multi-IB spare, 1 for the single-IB case (byte for byte 0.0.426), 0 when the frame was not spared. Pure,
