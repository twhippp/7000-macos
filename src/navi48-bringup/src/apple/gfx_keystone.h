// gfx_keystone.h — X10: MAY THE ROOT KEYSTONE BE ARMED FOR *THIS* COMMITTING FRAME, AND MAY THE FRAME THEN RUN?
// Pure C, host-tested by tests/gfx_keystone_test.cpp (with planted defects); the kext compiles the SAME header.
// 0.0.374. DEFAULT-INERT: every clause below is unreachable unless COMMIT is armed (clause 1).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS — arm3 and the four closed doors
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// arm3 COMMITTED a frame: the IB was rewritten in place, read back clean, SPARED by the ring walk, and the CP ran it.
// 290 ms later the GPU faulted — GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS 0x0024295d, VMID 2, walker error 6 (NACK), WRITE,
// FAULT ADDR -> VA 0x23f0580000 — with CP_IB1_BASE naming the committed IB.
//
// 0x23f0580000 is NOT a mistranslated address. It is `gRingMap.vaBase + XLAT12_GE_RING_POS_OFF` (0x00580000,
// xlat12_ib.h:217) — THE GE POSITION RING BASE THAT OUR OWN TRANSLATED STREAM PROGRAMS, the second of the three ring
// bases in the 15-dword NGG ring block (GE_POS_RING_BASE 0x309a0 = (base + 0x580000) >> 16). The GE wrote to it, the
// walker found root[511] EMPTY in WindowServer's table, and NACKed. Our own source records the same signature to the
// bit at AppleHardwareHook.cpp:7383 — "the GE had already walked the empty slot and NACKed ... The fix was correct and
// simply too late." arm3 is r96 again at a different offset, for the same reason.
//
// So the missing step is an ORDERING one: root[511] must be armed IN THE COMMITTING CONTEXT BEFORE THE DOORBELL.
// proved every path on an ARMED recipe is shut: `rootwritews` before `wskill` has no root to write (the pre-kill
// compositor never maps); after `wskill` the window between the root appearing and the committing frame is 154 ms,
// which no step list over ssh can hit; the mapVA `ARM NOW` trigger correctly refuses at G3 (root[0] is zero AT the
// transition, by construction — review change 3 closed that door after r96 deliberately); and
// render_drain_keystone() — the right write, in the right context, at writeTail before Apple's doorbell — is gated
// `gGfxNeuter != 1u`, so it runs only when the ring neuter is NOT armed, which every armed run must hold armed.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CALL SITE THIS HEADER SERVES, AND WHY IT IS THE COMMIT GATE AND NOT writeTail
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two candidates were weighed:
//   (a) call render_drain_keystone() at writeTail independently of the suite route;
//   (b) call it from the COMMIT gate — hook_gfxCommitIB's TRANSLATE branch, after the one-shot token matched and
//       BEFORE Apple's original writes the INDIRECT_BUFFER packet (and therefore before writeTail and the doorbell).
// (b) wins on all four things this header cares about:
//   1. NARROWEST WINDOW. The TRANSLATE branch is unreachable unless gfxsrc_decide_frame returned TRANSLATE, which
//      requires gXdArm == COMMIT and n48_cm_gate == COMMIT; and the one-shot means at most ONE frame per boot can
//      reach it. (a) runs on every GFX writeTail and would need a COMMIT test bolted on from outside.
//   2. STRONGEST IDENTITY AT THE INSTANT. At (b) the frame's own ws_classify result is in hand: BOUND by owner, the
//      frame's VMID's hardware page-table base equals the bound root, on the VMID recorded for that binding. (a) has
//      only CONTEXT2 (a register) and `ws_vmid_is_ws_now(2u)` — a HARD-CODED VMID 2, which is the defect class
//      ("a VMID number is an accident of order, never an identity").
//   3. A REFUSAL HAS SOMEWHERE TO GO. At (b) a refusal falls through to the existing neuter path: the frame is NOPed
//      and the CP never runs it. At (a) the gate has already answered COMMIT and the IB is already rewritten; there
//      is no way left to un-commit.
//   4. IT DOES NOT TOUCH gGfxNeuter. The ring neuter stays armed, which is the whole point.
// The cost of (b), stated: it does nothing for the render-drain suite route on neuter-disarmed runs. Those are not
// armed runs, and armed runs are what arm3 broke.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THE PREDICATE GUARANTEES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  * IT DOES NOTHING UNLESS COMMIT IS ARMED (clause 1). A judge-only run behaves exactly as 0.0.372 did.
//  * IT WRITES ONLY THE ROOT OF THE CONTEXT ws_ident HAS BOUND — and the binding is RE-VALIDATED AT THE INSTANT of
//    the write (clauses 4-8), never the copy ws_classify took earlier in the same call. The caller re-runs the whole
//    selection (liveness + snapshot + n48_ws_update_table) under gWsLock and feeds THOSE values in as `now_*`; the
//    values the frame was judged on come in as `frame_*`, and clause 6 refuses if they differ in any field.
//  * IT IS IDEMPOTENT (clauses 10-11). An entry already armed for this context is a LOGGED NO-OP that still lets the
//    frame run once the walks prove the mapping AND the entry's own recorded invalidate acknowledged for the VMID it
//    is armed on (0.0.374); a second ATTEMPT with no armed entry refuses outright.
//    K1 (0.0.410) / F1 (0.0.411): "ALREADY ARMED" IS PROVEN BY A LIVE READ of root[511] equal
//    to the recorded entry, not by the record's `wrote` latch. A record that says `wrote 1 withdrawn 0` while the live
//    slot differs (arm26's f16: zero, after the deferred withdrawal was applied) is a fail-closed REFUSAL
//    (REC_MISMATCH) — withdrew K1's re-arm write, so the keystone never repairs the record; the only writers stay
//    the first arm and hook_unmapVA's own re-arm. And while an unmap that did NOT decide DEFER is between its entry and
//    its exit the whole arm refuses (N48_KS_WITHDRAWING), because a write in that window is the hazard the withdrawal
//    exists to prevent. 0.0.423: a call that decides DEFER leaves root[511] standing and releases the
//    marker at once (n48_ks_withdraw_hold), so it no longer refuses a frame nothing threatens ('s over-refusal).
//  * EVERY REFUSAL HAS ITS OWN NAME AND ITS OWN LOG LINE (n48_ks_name).
//  * THE ARM IS PERMITTED ONLY IF THE MAPPING IS PROVEN AFTERWARDS (n48_ks_arm_permitted): the write must have read
//    back byte-identical, THE INVALIDATE FOR THE ARMED VMID MUST HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED (0.0.374), and
//    the post-write walk must resolve EVERY required VA through THAT context's own root. A committed frame never
//    runs against an unproven mapping - and a mapping the TLB was never told about is not proven, which neither the
//    read-back nor the walk can see.
//
// WITHDRAWAL is the existing one and is not re-implemented here: rootwrite_arm_context records `wrote` on the
// VmCtxObs BEFORE the write, so hook_unmapVA's withdrawal (root freed), hook_releaseVMContext's release observation
// and a WindowServer rebind (n48_ws_gone) all see and retire this entry exactly as they see `rootwritews`'s.

 * shared write path (rootwrite_arm_context) called navi48_gmc_flush_tlb_vmid(2, 0) with the 2 WRITTEN INTO THE CALL.
 * That made the clause a restatement of the defect it exists to prevent: "a VMID number is an accident of order,
 * never an identity". arm3 and arm5 bound VMID 2; hp4 bound VMID 3. On the VMID-3 side of that coin flip the keystone
 * refused before any write and the hardware window was spent for nothing.
 * The write path now takes the VMID as an argument (RootArmExtra::tlbVmid), so the invalidate covers whatever VMID
 * clauses 3/6/7 have ALREADY bound, re-read and proven in hardware. Clause 8 therefore no longer asks "is it 2"; it
 * asks only the one question that is still genuinely about the invalidate: CAN it serve this VMID AT ALL.
 * The boundary is the invalidate's own, not a guess: navi48_gmc_flush_tlb_vmid (Navi48Bringup.cpp:3033) returns false
 * for `vmid > 15` without touching a register, because gmc_flush_gpu_tlb builds PER_VMID_INVALIDATE_REQ as `1u << vmid`
 * into a 16-bit field (gmc_v12_0.cpp:1658). A VMID above 15 would shift out of the field: the request would be issued
 * for the WRONG VMID or for none, and the entry would be armed behind a TLB that never heard about it. The software
 * page walk CANNOT catch that case — it reads the table, not the TLB — so it has to stay a clause.
 * VMID 0 is refused one clause earlier, at clause 7's `now_vmid == 0`, and that is unchanged. */

 * THE KEYSTONE'S WHOLE PURPOSE is to guarantee that its root[511] write is VISIBLE TO THE GPU before the committing
 * frame's doorbell. The write itself is proven twice already — the read-back (write_status == 2) proves the bytes
 * landed in the page, and the four walks prove the PAGE TABLE resolves. NEITHER CAN SEE THE TLB. If the GFXHUB
 * invalidate was not acknowledged, the walker may still be serving the cached EMPTY root[511] that NACKed arm3, and
 * the frame would run on a guarantee we do not have.
 * This was masked until and is exposed BY. While clause 8 refused every bound VMID but 2 we only ever
 * armed on VMID 2, whose invalidate always ACKed in every run on record; retired that narrowing, so the keystone
 * can now arm on VMIDs we have never armed on, where nothing has ever been measured.
 * WHAT tlb_ack MUST BE. It is the ACK FOR THE VMID THE STANDING ENTRY IS ARMED ON, and it is 1 only when BOTH are
 * known: the invalidate returned true, AND it was issued for that VMID. "Not recorded" is 0 and refuses — the
 * fail-closed direction, and the same rule as walk_bits ("we forgot to walk" refuses like "it did not resolve").
 * IT APPLIES TO N48_KS_ALREADY AS WELL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. An idempotent re-arm performs NO invalidate at all
 * (AppleHardwareHook.cpp's no-op branch writes nothing and calls nothing), so on ALREADY there is no acknowledgement
 * from THIS call to look at; the one that matters belongs to whichever earlier write left the entry standing. Reading
 * a global "last arm" there would be worse than no gate — that result may be another context's, or another VMID's.
 * The caller therefore reads the ack RECORDED ON THE ENTRY, and an entry with nothing recorded refuses. Exempting
 * ALREADY would have been the fail-open answer: the entry a re-arm leaves standing is exactly the one whose
 * invalidate we have never checked. */

 * `leave` is one fewer and NEVER BELOW ZERO, and `withdrawing` is the predicate the keystone refuses on (non-zero, so a

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// 0.0.384 — THE WITHDRAW/RE-ARM WINDOW, AND WHY IT MUST BE DEFERRED WHILE A COMMITTED FRAME IS IN FLIGHT
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE MECHANISM, from arm10's own log. `hook_unmapVA` takes our entry DOWN on ANY unmap of an armed context: it clears
// root[511] to zero (low dword first), HDP-flushes, INVALIDATES the armed VMID's GFXHUB TLB, runs Apple's original
// unmapVA, and re-arms at the return if the page survived. That withdraw/re-arm pair is PREDICATE-FREE by design
// (r89: the root survived 10 of 11 unmaps, so guessing would be wrong more often than right) and it is what makes the
// teardown case safe — the page goes back to Apple's arena clean.
//
// It is also, for the duration of each pair, arm3's exact condition. arm10 logged THREE COMPLETE CYCLES between the
// COMMIT gate's OK and the first non-zero fault read — fires #5, #6 and #7 on the committing context, each
// `cleared … reads back 000000000000000000 (ZERO as intended); GFXHUB vmid-2 TLB invalidate ok` — WITH THE COMMITTED
// FRAME STILL EXECUTING. The fault that followed is bit-identical to arm3's: `0x0024295d` — VMID 2, walker error 6
// (NACK), PERMISSION_FAULTS 0x5 = VALID|WRITE in the FAILURE set (no valid translation at all), MAPPING_ERROR set,
// CID 0x14 = PA (the primitive assembler, the NGG position-ring writer), WRITE to VA 0x23f0580000 =
// `gRingMap.vaBase + XLAT12_GE_RING_POS_OFF` = GE_POS_RING_BASE. Every keystone proof on record — the read-back
// MATCHES, the TLB ack, all 16 `RESOLVES CORRECTLY` — was taken BEFORE the first withdrawal. CONFIRMED: the windows
// exist, are on the committing context, and bracket the fault. SUSPECTED: that PA's write fell INSIDE one rather than
// beside one — which is the single thing the in-window fault read (below) is added to settle.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SAFETY ENVELOPE — BOTH ENDS ARE REAL HAZARDS, AND THAT IS WHY THE ANSWER IS A BOUNDED DEFERRAL
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   WITHDRAW WHILE A COMMITTED FRAME IS IN FLIGHT  =>  the walker finds root[511] absent, NACKs, and the engine hangs.
//       CONFIRMED twice: arm3 and arm10 (`channel 51 GFX is hung!`, `Engine PM4 : Failed to reset!`, then a
//       watchdog panic eight seconds after the commit).
//   NEVER WITHDRAW AT ALL  =>  a VALID PDE of ours is left standing in a page Apple has FREED. The page is the next
//       client's leaf page within ~4 s, and index 511 of that client's table would then translate through our PDE into
//       our ring. That is the hazard the withdrawal was written for and it is not negotiable.
//   BOUNDED DEFERRAL keeps both: while the frame is in flight the entry STAYS ARMED (nothing is cleared, nothing is
//       invalidated) and the request is recorded; the moment the window ends the next unmap of that context performs
//       the full withdraw/flush/invalidate exactly as today. The window is closed by the EARLIEST of an observed
//       end-of-pipe and a bounded timeout, so it can never be open indefinitely.
//
//   IF THE TIMEOUT FIRES WITH THE FRAME STILL RUNNING the withdrawal proceeds and we are back in exactly today's
//   position — the same hazard, no worse, just later (SUSPECTED, from the shape of the mechanism: the clear, the
//   flush and the invalidate are the same three operations in the same order, on the same entry).
//
//   THE ONE HAZARD THIS ADDS, STATED PLAINLY: if the very call whose withdrawal we deferred is the call in which
//   Apple FREES the root page, the page returns to the arena with our PDE still in it. We learn that only at the
//   RETURN (ctx+0x98+0x20 reads 0), by which time the page is gone and nothing can be written to it. The caller must
//   therefore COUNT AND LOG that case unconditionally and retire the record so nothing ever writes there again; the
//   residual risk is the un-cleaned PDE itself. It is bounded by the window (≤ the timeout, and at most one window per
//   committed frame) and it is the price of not hanging the engine. A reviewer should weigh exactly this trade.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT "IN FLIGHT" IS, IN STATE THAT ALREADY EXISTS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   START. `gfxsrc_commit_try`'s `if (live && reason == N48_CM_OK && n48_cm_shot_spend(&gXdShot, gXdCmToken.seq))` —
//          the one instant a rewritten IB has been written to the client and read back clean, and the instant the
//          existing code already stamps `gXdShotSpentUs = drain_now_us()`. The caller records the same stamp into its
//          own flight record (a dedicated one, so that a TORN read is detectable: see `start_us` below).
//   END, whichever comes FIRST:
//     (a) END OF PIPE OBSERVED — `n48_f828_watch.ever`, this header's neighbour in gfx_fence828.h, documented there as
//         "1 once ANY readable poll equalled `want`. STICKY: never cleared (M11)" and reached through
//         `n48_f828_state(...) == N48_F828_ST_MATCHED` / `ST_MATCHED_REVERTED` ("OURS - THE COMMITTED FRAME REACHED
//         END OF PIPE"). It is the GPU's own CACHE_FLUSH_AND_INV_TS RELEASE_MEM writing a value only we write.
//         IT IS CONSERVATIVE IN THE SAFE DIRECTION: the slot is re-read only on LATER JUDGED FRAMES
//         (`kXdF828Polls` = 8), so `ever` is set at the next judged frame AFTER retirement, never before it.
//         IT IS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, and this is the honest limit of clause (a): it can only ever be 1 when the
//         fence828 switch (`gfxneuter 16 | 1 << 8`) was thrown, the rule found and rewrote the packet, the gate
//         committed that frame, and a later judged frame polled the slot. If judged frames stop arriving — which is
//         precisely what a hang does — `ever` stays 0 and clause (b) is the only end.
//         0.0.418 (E2): `ever` is STICKY and belongs to the last PROMOTED commit, so the answer must also carry that
//         commit's own FLIGHT (`n48_f828_eop_seen`): a later flight whose fence was refused never resets the latch and
//         must not be answered by it. The `eop` field below is therefore `ks_eop_seen()`, not `watch.ever` alone.
//     (b) A BOUNDED TIMEOUT. `now_us - start_us >= timeout_us`. SUSPECTED, and justified from the only measured
//         numbers this project has: arm8 and arm9 both matched at POLL 1, ~0.3 s after the commit, so 0.3 s is the
//         one measured commit-to-observed-retirement latency; arm10's hang was at +8 s. The caller's constant is
//         2 s — roughly six times the measured latency and a quarter of the measured time-to-hang.
//
// FAIL CLOSED ON UNCERTAINTY (clause order below): no input, no switch, nothing armed, no flight recorded, a TORN
// flight record, an unreadable clock, a clock that went backwards, or a zero timeout all answer WITHDRAW AS TODAY.
// A deferral is a decision to leave a VALID PDE standing, so it is granted only on evidence, never by omission —
// the same rule the rest of this header applies to `walk_bits` and to `tlb_ack`.

 * 0.0.431 — THE PREVIOUS FLIGHT IS SAVED AND RESTORED, NOT CLEARED.
 *
 * THE DEFECT 0.0.430 LEFT. `gKsFlight` is ONE record, stamped by every commit at the gate BEFORE the keystone runs
 * (`gfxsrc_commit_try`, AHH:20729-20732). At budget > 1 a second candidate B overwrites the record of a committed
 * frame A that may still be executing. 0.0.430 then CLEARED `active` when the keystone refused B, on the true premise
 * that B never ran — but that also erased A's flight, and hook_unmapVA's deferral then answered NOT_IN_FLIGHT and let
 * an unmap WITHDRAW root[511] while A still ran: the arm3/arm10 NACK-and-hang class. It is a NEW way in:
 * before 0.0.430, B's leftover stamp incidentally covered A for its bound.
 *
 * THE FIX. At the stamp the OUTGOING record {at_us, seq, active} is SAVED together with the token seq doing the
 * stamping (`stamp_seq`). In the keystone's refusal branch, when THIS call's stamp is still the one showing, the save
 * is RESTORED (at_us, then seq, then a release fence, then active, then a SEQ_CST fence — the producer's own store
 * order, so the TORN clause can never see active=1 behind a zero stamp). A restored A is visible to the deferral, so
 * `n48_ksd_eval` answers EOP the moment A's end of pipe was observed (`ks_eop_seen` compares the committed record's
 * flight to `gKsFlight.seq`, which is A's again —'s gain, kept) and otherwise defers to A's own bound. With NO
 * earlier flight the saved record is {0, 0, 0}, so the restore leaves `active = 0` — exactly 0.0.430's clear.
 *
 * PURE, AND CALLED BY THE KEXT (source-pinned): the save and the restore decision live here so the host suite drives
 * the real functions, not a copy. `n48_ks_flight_save` takes the record that was showing and returns the record to
 * STASH (its fields are the previous flight; `stamp_seq` is who stamped over it). `n48_ks_flight_restore_ok` is the
 * "this call did the stamp" test in its only form a later stamp cannot fool: `call_seq` (THIS refusing call's token
 * seq), the saved `stamp_seq` and the live record's `seq` must all be equal, so neither a later stamp nor an aliased
 * stash can make an older call restore a flight that is not its own. It REPLACES `n48_ksd_flight_after_keystone`,

/* =====================================================================================================================
 * build 0.0.497 — SWITCH 64: A BOUNDED WAIT AT THE KEYSTONE WHILE THE WITHDRAWAL MARKER IS HELD.
 *
 * WHY. RUN F's f1 was handed COMMIT and then refused VERDICT 15 because Apple's unmap of page-in copy
 * #6's temporary source map (`va 0x4000b8000 size 0x8000`) was between its ENTRY and its return when the keystone read
 * the marker - an unmap of a context in which NOTHING of ours was armed, so it could not DEFER and correctly held the
 * marker for its whole window (clause 9b). Its return line was logged between the keystone's two VERDICT lines: the
 * window closed a few log lines later. Refusing at once threw away the only commit of the arm.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGES, AND WHAT DOES NOT. With switch 64 ON the keystone, BEFORE it gathers any of its evidence (before
 * ks_revalidate, the record lookup, the marker's first read and the live root[511] read), polls the marker of the
 * frame's judged context for AT MOST N48_KS_WAIT_BOUND_US (and at most N48_KS_WAIT_MAX_POLLS short busy-waits, so a
 * clock that cannot be read still bounds it). Then EVERY check runs UNCHANGED - n48_ks_eval with its own fresh read of
 * the marker (clause 9b), the walks, the post-walk re-read (n48_ks_post_walk_withdrawn) and the bracket - all on
 * values read AFTER the wait. A marker still held at the bound is therefore today's VERDICT 15, fail-closed: the wait
 * decides NOTHING, it only moves the instant the unchanged checks are taken. KEYSTONE-A-PRIME's row "Withdraw: X<V"
 * (the unmap's exit before the keystone's evaluation) is the safe row; a release inside the bound turns RUN F's E<V<X
 * into exactly that row, and an unmap that re-enters after the release is caught by the unchanged clause 9b or the
 * post-walk re-read, as today.
 *
 * NO LOCK IS HELD WHILE WAITING (AppleHardwareHook.cpp, ks_wait_marker_bounded's comment): gXdLock is released at the
 * end of gfxsrc_decide_frame and gWsLock is taken only inside ks_revalidate, which runs after the wait. The pause is a
 * busy-wait (IODelay), never a sleep, and nothing here takes a lock.
 *
 * PURE: the loop below is the one the kext runs, through three callbacks (the marker read, the clock, the pause), so the
 * host suite drives the SAME loop with a scripted marker and clock (gfx_keystone_test.cpp section W).
