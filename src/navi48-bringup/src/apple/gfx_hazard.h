/* gfx_hazard.h — 0.0.395, notes/design/R5-REDESIGN.md v2 "Capacity — (a)" and "Keying is PHYSICAL, not VA":
 * THE ARM-SCOPED HAZARD PAGE SET, keyed by the RESOLVED PHYSICAL PAGE.
 *
 * WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH. Through 0.0.394 R5's memory-destination question ("did a held-back frame
 * write a page THIS consumer points at?") was answered by walking `n48_cp_ring`'s per-frame rows and comparing VAs
 * (`n48_cp_is_memdst`). A VA-keyed answer is unsound across two processes that share one IOSurface under different VAs,
 * and the 32-row ring OVERFLOWED 831 TIMES on arm20's own boot, so the record it answered from was
 * incomplete in exactly the fail-open direction. The memo replaces the ring's role with a page set:
 *
 *   - a 64-ROW EXACT TABLE (page, VA, hits, first namer) that is an INSTRUMENT and the only COUNT source (arm21 line 4:
 *     "The count comes from the exact table's `hits`, never the filter, which answers membership only"); and
 *   - a 1024-BIT TWO-HASH FILTER that is the MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY. A filter cannot overflow, so no capacity can refuse
 *     for that reason; its only imprecision is a FALSE POSITIVE, which refuses MORE (the safe direction), never fewer.
 *     The memo measured occupancy at ~23 target pages on the real window = ~4% of 1024 bits.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION, three ways, and each is a mutant the R5′ suite plants:
 *   1. a NULL/absent set answers HIT (no set is not an empty set);
 *   2. a page of 0 - an UNRESOLVED destination - answers HIT, so an unresolved destination can never read as "not named";
 *   3. membership needs BOTH hash bits set, and adding a page sets both. There is no branch that clears a bit.
 *
 * Pure C (`gfx_dep.h` is compiled as C by some of its consumers and this file is included from it), no allocation, no
 * static state of its own. Host-tested by tests/gfx_dep_test.cpp.
 *
 * 0.0.397: `n48_hz_hit` is the ONE membership question and it now COUNTS itself, into `queries`/`hits`.
 * Through 0.0.396 neither was ever incremented, so arm21 line 2 printed `queries 0, hits 0` however often R3 asked -
 * a liar. The counting is on the passed struct, so the header still owns no state; the answer itself is unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT IS **NOT** HERE. The per-frame decode - what a colour target is, what a memory destination is, how a dispatch's
 * V# is read - lives in gfx_dep.h beside `n48_cp_scan_frame`, which this file does not include. This file owns only the
 * set and the two hashes. */
