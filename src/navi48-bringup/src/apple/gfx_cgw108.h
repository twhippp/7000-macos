/* gfx_cgw108.h — build 0.0.550 ( PLAN step 1,, notes/design/RING-NEUTER-FORGIVE.md FIX 2):
 * SWITCH 108 "cgwait", THE COPY-GUARD WAIT UNDER SWITCH 37. `108 | M << 8`: M 1 ON (= 364), M 2 OFF (= 620, the default and the
 * boot value); bare `108` reads. Mid-arm guarded. No SHADOW: switch 78 already counts every refusal ON would take on
 * (`IN_FLIGHT not redone under 37`), so a SHADOW mode would print that same count again.
 *
 * WHY. RUN AX/AY's frame 1 P was refused copy-guard IN_FLIGHT on a page new to its segment, with switch 78's redo declining it
 * `37-on` (run11as `cguard-ref: f1 seg 0/1 IN_FLIGHT ... new-in-seg ... redo 37-on`): with switch 37 ON the pass owns MM-window
 * priority (gfxsrc_policy opens Navi48MmPrioScope first), so the copier yields to the pass and a wait inside the pass is futile
 * (RING-NEUTER-FORGIVE.md: "IN_FLIGHT waits are futile under switch 37").'s review bounded the wait at 2 ms per frame and
 * only with 37 OFF.
 *
 * WHAT ON CHANGES, AND ONLY THIS. Switch 78's redo is live (ON implies it, whatever 78 says), and an IN_FLIGHT refusal under
 * switch 37 is WAITED ON instead of declined: for the wait only, the pass RELEASES its MM-window priority (Navi48MmPrioRelease,
 * Navi48Ttl.hpp: the scope's nesting drops to 0 so a copier does not yield, and is re-entered before the re-translate), within
 * the SAME per-frame budget 78 uses (N48_CG_REDO_WAIT_US = 2000 us per frame, gCgRedoF.waitUs, polled every 50 us). If the
 * copy cleared, the segment is undone and re-translated ONCE (78's n48_cg_redo_seq: seg_redone and N48_CG_REDO_FRAME_MAX hold),
 * and the unchanged counted navi48_cg_seg_check at its original site stays the ONLY admit. Not clear: refused as today. A
 * self-owned slot and an earlier segment's page stay ineligible exactly as 78 has them. OFF: 78 is 0.0.549's.
 *
 * Pure: no lock, no clock, no log, no register. Host-tested by tests/gfx_cgredo_test.cpp (cgw108 section). */
