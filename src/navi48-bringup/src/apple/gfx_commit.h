// gfx_commit.h — X1: THE COMMIT GATE. What must be true before a translated frame is allowed to reach the CP, expressed as data
// (0.0.352). Pure C, host-tested by tests/gfx_commit_test.cpp; the kext compiles the SAME header.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE HEADER, AND WHY IT IS DATA RATHER THAN CODE.
// `gfx_src_decide.h`'s n48_sd_action already says the rule in one line: at COMMIT, a frame translates only when the verdict is
// TRANSLATE **and** `commit_ok`. Its comment has said since 0.0.302 that "`commit_ok` is 1 only when the caller has ALREADY
// rewritten the IB and read it back", and until 0.0.351 the caller passed the literal `0u` — so the sentence was a promise, not a
// mechanism. This header is the mechanism. Everything the caller learns while rewriting is written into ONE zero-initialised
// struct, and `n48_cm_gate` refuses unless EVERY field was positively set to the value that means "verified". A field nobody
// filled is 0, and 0 refuses at every single rung. That is what "fail-closed by construction" means here: there is no path
// through this function that reaches N48_CM_OK by omission, and a caller that forgets a step cannot get a commit by default.
//
// THE MUTANT THIS IS BUILT AGAINST, in the project's own words: **"`commit_ok` with a rewrite that did not read back clean" MUST
// NEUTER.** It is the first thing tests/gfx_commit_test.cpp checks, exhaustively — every single-dword corruption of a real IB
// length, plus a short read, plus a read that crossed a page that was not host memory — and each one must come out of
// n48_sd_action as N48_SD_ACT_NEUTER, not as a translate. An untranslated (or half-translated) IB reaching the CP is what hung
// the engine in `live2`; the neuter is the fallback and it works.
//
// TWO ASYMMETRIES THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT INHERIT (both found by the review of the ladder):
//   1. `n48_xv_frame.target_vram` is fail-OPEN on an unresolvable target — AppleHardwareHook.cpp `if (ok && !isSys)
//      f.target_vram = 1;` sets no flag when the page walk FAILS, so a target we could not resolve does not refuse. Here the
//      opposite holds and is checked twice: `pages` must be non-zero and `sys_pages` must EQUAL it, so a page that did not
//      resolve, or resolved to VRAM, refuses. An unresolvable anything refuses.
//   2. The IB policy runs over IB 0 only (`gfxsrc_policy(vm, &f, f.ib[0].got)`), while a frame may carry up to four IBs and the
//      ladder judges the shape of all of them. A multi-IB frame let through would send IBs 1..3 to the CP **untranslated** —
//      exactly the shape that hung the engine. `nib` must be 1. Nothing else in the ladder says this.

/* 0.0.369 — WHICH RECOGNISER PRODUCED THIS FRAME'S SEGMENTS, AND WHY THE GATE HAS TO BE TOLD.
 * Until 0.0.368 the coverage rung said `start == head + 2` unconditionally: Apple's encoder head (EVENT_WRITE 0x16,
 * ACQUIRE_MEM, EVENT_WRITE 0xE) is two dwords the draw policy does not translate, so a segment's body starts two dwords after
 * its head and anything else meant the rewrite would move the draw. The compositor's SETUP HALVES (1456
 * dwords) carry no such head anywhere: xlat12_headless.h's recogniser splits them into render passes whose `start == head` —
 * the pass's own CONTEXT_CONTROL, which the draw policy DOES translate. Both shapes are legitimate and they are NOT
 * interchangeable, so the frame must say which one it is and every segment must have that kind's shape.
 *
 * THE HEADLESS SHAPE IS THE TIGHTER OF THE TWO, not the looser one, and that is the whole reason it may be admitted:
 *   - no dword of Apple's survives in a headless segment. The recogniser emits `head == start`, so the translator's output
 *     covers the pass end to end and rewrites the CONTEXT_CONTROL into its proven form. In an encoder segment Apple's two
 *     head dwords are passed through untouched.
 *   - every value check still runs on it: the register allowlist, the operand rules, the per-stage program resolver, the
 *     interpolation guard and the descriptor rung all act inside xlat12_ib_translate_draw_ex, which does not know or care
 *     which recogniser found the segment.
 * WHAT THE RECOGNISER DOES NOT PROVE, stated here because the rung depends on it: it judges SHAPE, NOT PROVENANCE (it accepts
 * 12,521 of 20,000 shape-valid corruptions of a real setup half). A foreign stream in that shape is accepted BY IT. What makes
 * that acceptable is everything in this gate downstream: the bytes that reach the CP are read back and compared dword for
 * dword against the translator's OWN output, and the frame's identity is re-established at the hook. Neither may be weakened
 * on the strength of the recogniser, and the recogniser may not be relaxed on the strength of them.
 *
 * MIXED REFUSES. There is ONE kind per frame, not one per segment, so a frame carrying both shapes cannot be described and
 * refuses at N48_CM_SEG_KIND — whichever kind it claims, the other half's segments do not have that kind's shape. 0 is

 * WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN AppleHardwareHook.cpp. found a PHANTOM LEVER: `accel gfxneuter 4` had refused since
 * 0.0.352 and `gXdArm` had exactly two assignments in the whole tree, DECIDE and OFF, so `N48_CM_OK` was unreachable for
 * every frame however clean the world — and the project's own prose had promoted the planned lever to an existing one.
 * The lever is built here, as DATA, for the same reason the gate above is data: a condition that lives in an `if` inside a
 * 19,000-line file is reviewed once; a condition that lives in a pure function is host-tested, mutated, and cannot rot.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE THINGS, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE DEFECT THIS SPLIT EXISTS TO PREVENT:
 *   1. n48_cm_arm_missing — MAY the arm be set at all? Asked ONCE, by the verb, against the live world. It is the
 *      pre-arm checklist expressed as a bitmask, and it names EVERY missing item rather than the first, because the point
 *      of the refusal is to tell the operator what to fix, not to stop at the first thing.
 *   2. n48_cm_shot_* — the ONE-SHOT. Having been set, how long does the arm last? Exactly one committed frame.
 * Neither may weaken the per-frame gate above. Arming makes `arm == COMMIT` TRUE; it does not make any other rung pass.

 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the DROPPED-WRITE COUNTS. proved that `source-neuter` cannot be 0 in judge-only mode

 * ARMED -> SPENT -> DONE, and ARMED -> CANCELLED. The blast radius is exactly one frame because a NEW frame is handed
 * COMMIT only in ARMED, and the gate answering N48_CM_OK for one frame moves it to SPENT.
 *
 * WHY SPENT AND DONE ARE TWO STATES, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE THIS DEPARTS FROM THE ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION "disarm the instant
 * the gate answers OK". The arm level is read a SECOND time, AFTER the gate, by something the gate knows nothing about:
 * the ring walk's exemption (gfx_neuter.h `n48_gfxn_exempt_why`, condition (1) `arm != N48_GFXN_ARM_COMMIT`), which runs
 * inside Apple's own `commitIndirectCommandBuffer` on the same thread and is what decides whether the committed IB is
 * spared from the NOP. Writing DECIDE into the arm level at the gate would therefore make the walk NOP the very IB we had
 * just rewritten and read back: the frame would commit on paper and draw nothing, and the run would score N/A on its own
 * headline. So:
 *   SPENT  is entered AT the gate's OK and is what stops the frame AFTER the budget's last: n48_cm_shot_level hands
 *          COMMIT out only in ARMED, so no later frame can be judged at COMMIT even before the level variable moves.
 *          0.0.381 puts a BUDGET in front of that transition - see 2a - and at the default budget of 1 the
 *          transition happens on the first spend, which is this paragraph unchanged.
 *   DONE   is entered when that frame's submission has RETURNED, and is when the caller writes DECIDE into the level.
 * The two are one frame apart on one thread, and the safety property "at most one frame is ever handed COMMIT" is carried
 * by SPENT, not by the level variable. n48_cm_shot_spend is idempotent for exactly this reason: it answers 1 once.
 *
 * WINDOWSERVER'S BINDING, AND WHY "ANY CHANGE CANCELS" WOULD BE WRONG HERE. The arm is set BEFORE `wskill`, and at that
 * moment ws_ident reads `state NONE ... binds 0 (rebinds 0), unbinds 0` (hp9's own log,): the compositor that will
 * draw the committed frame DOES NOT EXIST YET. So cancelling on any change of binding would cancel on the very bind the
 * run exists to catch. What must not survive is a binding being REPLACED or LOST under the arm — a second compositor, a
 * freed root — so the rule is: at most ONE new binding may appear after arming, and it must appear cleanly. A rebind, an
 * unbind, a `gone`, or a second bind all cancel; a counter that went DOWN cancels too, because a record that is not
 * monotone is not a record. */

/* ---- 2a. THE N-FRAME BUDGET (0.0.381) -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A ONE-SHOT IS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHY THIS IS NOT A LOOSENING OF THE ONE-SHOT. measured the problem: COMMIT is a
 * one-shot that disarms the instant a frame commits, `arm9` spent it on `f1` at `sn 0`, and the frames anything later can
 * buy are `f15` and `f29` - 14 and 28 frames later, ~0.25 s and ~0.5 s at 60 Hz. No operator step list can re-arm by hand
 * inside that window, so a second-commit experiment cannot be run at all without this. The budget does NOT make any frame
 * commit that would not have committed: every rung of n48_cm_gate, n48_xv_decide, n48_dep_check and the ring exemption is
 * untouched. It changes exactly one thing: HOW MANY frames that clear all of them may do so before the arm is spent.
 *
 * DEFAULT N = 1, AND THAT IS TODAY BYTE FOR BYTE. `budget` 0 is read as 1 (a caller that forgot the field gets the
 * one-shot, never more), and at budget 1 the first accepted spend takes `spent` 0 -> 1, 1 >= 1, and the state moves
 * ARMED -> SPENT on that same call, exactly as 0.0.380's `n48_cm_shot_spend` did unconditionally.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT PER TOKEN SEQ, NOT PER CALL - AND THIS IS THE DEFECT THE SPLIT EXISTS TO PREVENT. Until 0.0.380 the
 * idempotence was carried by the STATE: the second call for the same frame found SPENT and answered 0. With a budget
 * above 1 the state is still ARMED after the first spend, so a second call for the SAME frame would charge the budget
 * twice and halve it silently. `last_seq` is therefore the key: a spend is accepted once per distinct token seq, and a
 * repeat for the seq just charged answers 0 without moving anything. `spent != 0` guards the initial `last_seq` 0, so a
 * token seq of 0 is charged normally rather than mistaken for a repeat.
 *
 * A WASTED SPEND STILL COSTS BUDGET. `n48_cm_shot_finish`'s caller also calls it when the spent frame was neutered at the
 * hook instead (TRANSLATE WITHDRAWN). At budget 1 that put the arm away; at budget N the state is still ARMED and finish
 * answers 0, so the arm stands and the next frame may use the REMAINING budget. The charge is not refunded: a spend that
 * reached the client's memory and then lost its identity is exactly the event the bound is counting.
 *
 * THE CEILING. N48_CM_SHOT_BUDGET_MAX is 4 and the rule coerces anything above it back to 1 rather than accepting it.
 * The project has evidence for exactly three frames worth committing (`f1`, `f15`, `f29` - ) and 4 is one of
 * slack; every unit above that is another live rewrite of Apple's instruction stream bought with no measurement behind
 * it. The verb refuses an out-of-range N outright; this is the second of the two guards, not the first. */

/* C3 (0.0.461 review) — THE CONTINUOUS ARM'S OWN REFUSAL CHECKLIST, AS A PURE FUNCTION. Through 0.0.460 this was
 * six `if`s inline in the verb (AppleHardwareHook.cpp's `hw_hook_gfx_neuter`, switch 4) - exactly the shape
 * the project's own rule warns about ("a condition that lives in an `if` inside a 19,000-line file is reviewed
 * once"), and the review's own planted break (C3: deleting the switch-22 line) went uncaught because nothing
 * outside that one `if` could prove it was reachable. Moved here so the SAME function the kext calls is the one a
 * host test drives directly, with real booleans, in the real bit layout - a deleted `if` becomes a bit that never
 * sets, provably, rather than a line a reviewer has to notice is missing.
 * Bits (unchanged from 0.0.460's own numbering, so the verb's report line's bit-name table needs no edit):
 *   0x1  switch 22 (in-flight deferral) not ON     0x2  switch 16 (fence un-NOP) not ON
 *   0x4  switch 15 (X9-F forgiveness) ON            0x8  switch 19 (Exit C running budget) ON
 *   0x10 the frame cap has no room for N + margin   0x20 switch 35 (second window/plane) not ON (F2(a))
 *   0x40 a VM fault is ALREADY LATCHED at the arm (M5, 0.0.462 review) - see below
 * `capRoom` is the caller's OWN pre-computed boolean ("gXdFrameCap - gXdC.judged >= N + margin", including the
 * underflow guard) - this function does not read gXdFrameCap/gXdC.judged itself, so it stays free of every kext
 * global exactly like n48_cm_arm_missing above it.
 *
 * M5 (0.0.462 review) — `noFaultLatched`. 0.0.461's VM_FAULT stop only ever catches a fault that TRANSITIONS from
 * clear to latched AFTER the arm (the raw-status comparison n48_cm_shot_stop_if_rose's caller now does), by
 * design - it must never fire on a fault that already existed. The gap that fix left: a fault ALREADY latched at
 * arm time is then invisible for the REST of the arm too, since the hardware register is never cleared and the
 * transition can never re-fire. 0.0.461 called that "blinding the stop" and accepted it; 0.0.462 refuses the arm
 * instead (fail closed - the operator runs `accel faultclear` first, exactly as every other C16 vm-fault reader in
 * this file already expects), so a continuous run's OWN fault-detection window starts clean or does not start. */

 * build 0.0.463 item 2 — THE MID-ARM SWITCH GUARD FOR SWITCHES 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ONE FUNCTION AND NOT TEN `if`s. Switches 22, 16, 19, 35, 37 and 38 each carry their OWN inline
 * `gXdShot.cont && gXdShot.state == N48_CM_SHOT_ARMED` guard, written once per verb handler in AppleHardwareHook.cpp
 * — exactly the shape the project's own rule warns about ("a condition that lives in an `if` inside a 27,000-line
 * file is reviewed once"). None of those ten policy-pass switches (43-50, 52, 53) is part of the arm's OWN
 * checklist (n48_cm_cont_arm_missing), so none of them needs to be ON or OFF for the arm to stand; what they share
 * is that EVERY one of them reshapes what the policy pass or the commit gate does to a frame, and a continuous
 * run's own measurements must not see that change happen under them — the same reasoning switch 37's own comment
 * (0.0.461 review, "SMALLER") already gives for itself. Putting the LIST and the PREDICATE in one pure function
 * means a verb handler that forgets to call it is a missing call a source pin can name, rather than a six-line `if`
 * a reviewer has to notice is absent from one handler out of ten.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the list does not include switch 41 (continuous mode itself — arming IS the
 * lever), or any switch already guarded elsewhere (3, 15, 16, 19, 22, 35, 37, 38) — this function's OWN list is
 * exactly the ten this build task names, checked by `n48_cm_cont_switch_guarded` below, and no other switch is
 * ever refused by it.
 *
 * build 0.0.471 item 2 adds an eleventh: switch 51 (0.0.470's no-sampler/class-10 table-shape lever) joins
 * this same list and calls this same function, for the same reason switch 52 or 53 does — it reshapes what a
 * draw's table step does without being part of the continuous arm's own checklist.
 *
 * build 0.0.472 item 2 adds a twelfth: switch 54 (0.0.457's colour-target scan over every item and every
 * draw) joins this same list for the same reason — it reshapes what the policy pass's target rung sees without
 * being part of the continuous arm's own checklist.
 *
 * build 0.0.480 adds a thirteenth: switch 55 (continuation units) joins for the same reason - it reshapes what the
 * policy pass translates (a unit instead of its constituents) without being part of the continuous arm's own checklist.
 * build 0.0.481 adds a fourteenth: switch 56 (a single segment refused for room retried through the unit path) joins
 * for the same reason - it reshapes what a single segment translates to.
 * build 0.0.485 adds a fifteenth: switch 58 (per-draw colour-target pages and the re-shape REPLACE in the producer
 * ledger, gfx_desc_port.h) joins for the same reason - it reshapes what the ledger can prove to a later frame's provenance
 * ask.
 * build 0.0.487 adds a sixteenth: switch 57 (the compute-N elide, notes/design/COMPUTE-N.md) joins for the same reason
 * - it reshapes what a segment carrying Apple's compute clear translates to, and which frames the gate may commit.
 * build 0.0.488 adds a seventeenth: switch 60 (the DCC T# strip, notes/design/DCC-DESC.md) joins for the same reason - it
 * reshapes which table records a draw's descriptor step translates and what it asks the ledger to prove.
 * build 0.0.486 adds switch 59 (the backing-sourced static textures, notes/design/STATIC-RETILE.md) for the same reason -
 * it reshapes which residency entries a draw's T# ask can be answered by, and what the placed T# says.
 * MERGE 0.0.489: the union of every build's entry (0.0.485's 58, 0.0.487's 57, 0.0.488's 60, 0.0.486's 59).
 * build 0.0.490 adds switch 42 (R1, the memory-destination rung): its mode decides whether md_ok gates
 * `live` and the gate's MEMDST rung (ENFORCE) or is only counted (SHADOW/OFF), so a flip under a continuous arm would change
 * which frames commit mid-measurement. The first switch below 43 in this list; a bare `42` read stays allowed.
 * build 0.0.494 adds switch 61 (the D4' image-union fold and the overflow attribution): it reshapes what
 * the D4' union holds and which count its overflow refuses with, so a flip under a continuous arm would change which
 * frames' dep rung refuses mid-measurement (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:61).
 * build 0.0.495 adds switch 62 (the shader-heap copy / substitution race): it changes which frames the commit
 * and the ring exemption refuse and what the residency copy writes, so a flip under a continuous arm would change which frames
 * commit mid-measurement (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:62).
 * build 0.0.496 adds switch 63 (the residency copy through SDMA): it changes how every residency copy reaches
 * VRAM (and binds the staging buffer and runs the positive control at its first ON), so it is changed only before an arm
 * (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:63).
 * build 0.0.497 adds switch 64 (the keystone's bounded wait and the fill-member retirement at a keystone
 * withdrawal): it changes which frames the keystone lets run and when the fill window closes, so it is changed only before an
 * arm (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:64).
 * build 0.0.498 adds switch 65 (end of pipe asked at the deferral's expiry): it changes whether an
 * expired deferral withdraws or retires a finished flight, so it is changed only before an arm (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:65).
 * build 0.0.500 (notes/design/DRAW-ELIDE.md Q4) adds switch 66 (the draw elide): it changes which draws a candidate
 * carries, so it is changed only before an arm (PIN SWITCH-GUARD:66).
 *
 *   switch_no  the verb's own selector. Only 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,
 *              61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and 66 are ever refused here.
 *   is_read    1 when this call carries no attempted ON/OFF change (M 0, a bare read) — a read is ALWAYS allowed,
 *              at any arm state, matching every other mid-arm guard's own "read stays allowed" identity.
 *   cont       gXdShot.cont, the caller's OWN reading — never recomputed here.
 *   state      gXdShot.state, the caller's OWN reading — never recomputed here.
 * Refuses (1) only when NOT a read, the shot IS continuous, and the shot is standing ARMED — the exact predicate
 * `gfxneuter 3`'s own C5-part-2 guard uses (gfx_commit_test.cpp's PIN C5). A one-shot arm (`cont` 0) and a
 * SPENT/DONE/CANCELLED/OFF continuous shot are both unaffected (OFF identity: this answers 0 for every state but
 * ARMED, and 0 for every `cont` but 1). */

 * build 0.0.490 item 1 ( (B) item 9; the reviewer's correction of the brief) — THE ARM-VERB REFUSAL
 * FOR R1 ENFORCE. Under switch 42 ENFORCE a CLEAN R1 verdict discharges R4's wait/write refusal (gfxsrc_cprov_eval), which
 * makes the HEADLESS producers (switch 13's setup halves, R1-MEMDST.md Q1: each carries a live WAIT/RELEASE_MEM triplet)
 * eligible to commit for the first time - a path nobody has reviewed. A CONTINUOUS arm cannot commit them (they are
 * multi-segment single-IB frames: the owned-slot fence refuses them MULTI-SEGMENT and the gate's continuous fence rung is
 * asked before MEMDST), so only a ONE-SHOT arm is refused. The pre-arm checklist (n48_cm_arm_missing) REQUIRES switch 13 ON
 * for every arm, so "13 ON" alone cannot be the refusal's other half without making ENFORCE unarmable; the refusal is:
 *   a ONE-SHOT arm (no continuous request pending: `cont_requested` 0) while 42 is ENFORCE and 13 is ON.
 *   cont_requested  gXdContN != 0 - the arm about to be set is continuous (the verb's own branch condition).
