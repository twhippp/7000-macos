// gfx_subst_pool.h — build 0.0.484 (notes/design/GLASS.md Q2 K2, (2)). THE RECOGNITION POOL'S BUILD, pure.
//
// gfxsrc_xlat_open (AppleHardwareHook.cpp) renders, once, the image every substitutable shader-cache entry writes over
// Apple's program, so a byte compare at a program VA can say "these bytes are already OURS" (n48_xd_ours_find,
// gfx_subst_caps.h). Through 0.0.483 its loop stopped at the cap (`gXdSubstN < kXdSubstMax`) and said nothing about the
// entries past it: r17 holds 90 substitutable entries against a cap of 96, r18 will hold 92-93, and a blob that grew
// past the cap would silently leave its last programs unrecognisable - they would read program-unknown on hardware
// with no line saying why. The loop is here now, and it COUNTS every substitutable entry it never rendered because the
// pool was full (`dropped`), which the kext prints on its open line and in its boot guard.
//
// Same order, same refusals as the loop it replaces: entries in blob index order, a non-substitutable entry skipped,
// sc_subst_image into row n of the pool, SC_E_CAPACITY counted as `tooBig`, any other refusal as `refused`, and only a
// rendered image (nb > 0) takes a row. With `pool` NULL nothing is rendered and nothing is written to `rows`: the call
// only counts `substitutable` and `dropped` - the boot guard's census, which must not allocate the 672 KiB pool on a
// boot that never arms the decision. Census `dropped` assumes every substitutable entry renders, so it is an UPPER
// BOUND on the real build's (exact whenever nothing is refused; a refused entry frees its row for a later one).
