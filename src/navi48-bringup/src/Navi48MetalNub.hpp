//
//  Navi48MetalNub.hpp - the software nub the Aux-KC accelerator kext (Navi48Accel) matches, kext 0.0.610, milestone #9 route A (notes/design/NATIVE-S3.md sec. 1).
//
//  Navi48MetalNub : IOService, attached to Navi48Bringup, published ONLY on demand by the native client's selector N48N_SEL_METAL_NUB_PUBLISH (ABI 1.8), and
//  only with boot-arg navi48-metal=1 on a native boot whose S1b reported POSITIVE PASS, the GPU not HUNG and a Hello'd session. NEVER at boot. It matches
//  nothing by itself; the aux kext's personality (IOProviderClass Navi48MetalNub, IOMatchCategory IOAccelerator) is what makes an accelerator appear under it.
//  0.0.612: it carries "Navi48,Ready" (1 while the native path is usable, 0 once the HUNG latch tripped; sticky). It touches no hardware: publishing it writes no register. Withdraw terminates it (the accelerator under it stops and is released).
//
//  The nub also answers callPlatformFunction("n48.metal.ops", waitForFunction=false, &ops, ...) with the versioned ops table of Navi48MetalOps.h: every decision
//  the aux kext makes (IOAccelConfig contents, stamp page, task window, factory mask, memory-map hooks, logging) lives in that table, in this kext, so the aux kext
//  (whose every rebuild requires a security approval (Allow click) from the user) can stay untouched. The pure parts are amd/native_metal_pure.h (host-tested).
