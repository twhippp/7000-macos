// gfx_flightring_test.cpp — C5 part 1 (0.0.443, notes/design/C5-CONTINUOUS.md Q1): THE FLIGHT RING'S SAFETY PROOF.
//
// Every clause of gfx_flightring.h is exercised, each with a PLANTED BREAK that must be CAUGHT (the project's own
// non-vacuity rule): a test no mutation can break is not testing anything.
//
//   B1  an earlier un-retired entry defers a withdrawal (break: today's latest-flight-only rule - only the newest
//       entry is asked)
//   B2  a refusal frees only its own entry (break: the whole ring is cleared on refusal)
//   B3  the ring full refuses (break: the oldest entry is silently overwritten instead)
//   B4  OUT-OF-ORDER is detected (break: only the newest entry is polled/considered)
//   B5  NOT_RUN never counts as retired (break: NOT_RUN is treated as RETIRED / can retire)
//   B6  budget 1 is IDENTICAL to 0.0.442's n48_ksd_eval, field for field, across every one of its seven verdicts AND
//       across a REAL recorded sequence (modelled on arm35 seq 11's own timeline: push, several judged-frame polls
//       that do not yet match, then the poll that matches, with unmap-decision points threaded throughout)
//   B7  the report format (N48_FR_REPORT_FMT) fits under the logger's cap at its widest arguments
//   0.0.446 ( fixes (1)-(4)), each with a planted model of the old behaviour on the same inputs:
//   fix1 the newest seq/retired/expired restored on a free of the newest; an expired newest answers NOW_TIMEOUT;
//        the newest flight is named at the COMMIT mark (n48_fr_commit_mark), never at the push
//   fix2 the poll walks n48_fr_next_poll (ordinal order): no false OUT-OF-ORDER after a reclaimed slot is reused
//   fix3 reclamation after the tgtsample AFTER, holding a slot's pending seq (driven through n48_ts_after_eval)
//   fix4 n48_fr_keystone_guard (== 0.0.444's inline predicate) and its own line, which claims no keystone verdict
