// gfx_fence828_test.cpp — the offline proof for the one-dword un-NOP and (0.0.413) the OWNED SLOT.
// (; notes/design/FENCE-OWNED-SLOT.md,).
//
// The properties under test are the specification of the change:
//
//     1. IT READS BEFORE IT WRITES. Every dword the rewrite depends on is matched against what was read, at the
//        instant of the write, and a single changed dword refuses the whole thing without writing ANY dword. 0.0.413:
//        the two ADDRESS words are re-proven as their own step, so "an address word moved under us" has its own reason
//        (N48_F828_ADDR_UNPROVEN) and a break that skips one of them is caught (M13).
//     2. IT ONLY EVER STARTS FROM THE MEASURED DEAD PAGE. Apple's packet is still required to point at the dead page
//        (that is how we recognise it); the LIVE page is refused by name.
//     3. IT REFUSES, NEVER FORCES. A segment with no trailing NOP, or with more than one buried fence, or whose
//        packet differs from Apple's in ANY field, gets a named refusal and an untouched stream.
//     4. IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE LENGTH OR THE SHAPE. After the rewrite the stream still walks end to end, still
//        ends exactly at n, holds exactly one more packet, and the CP lands on the SAME next dword. FOUR dwords change:
//        the NOP header, the two ADDRESS words (re-pointed at OUR owned slot), and DATA_LO.
//     5. IT RAISES NO INTERRUPT. A packet whose INT_SEL is not 0 is refused rather than enabled.
//     6. THE VERDICT IS A LATCH, NOT A SAMPLE (0.0.378). The question is existential - "did the slot
//        EVER hold a value only we write?" - so a match on ANY poll is a proof, a later non-match is a REVERSION
//        that is recorded beside it and not instead of it, and an unreadable poll decides nothing in either
//        direction. The seven states are a ladder: no two can be true at once.
//     7. THE VALUE IS epoch|ordinal (0.0.413, B3). A value from ANOTHER boot, ANOTHER ordinal, or equal to the value
//        read BEFORE the commit never counts as end-of-pipe (B6).
//     8. THE CANDIDATE AND THE COMMITTED FRAME ARE SEPARATE RECORDS, AND THE WATCH RESET IS AT THE COMMIT
//        PROMOTION (0.0.413 B5; 0.0.415 Q4). The translate-time candidate site writes only the candidate record;
//        a candidate the gate or the keystone refuses never touches the committed record or its latch, so a
//        committed frame still in flight keeps its watch (M18/M19,).
//
// The good input is REAL: two of arm6's own compositor segments as the translator produced them on the armed path
// (fixture_fence828.h). Everything perturbed below is perturbed from those bytes, not from an invention.
//
// PLANTED-DEFECT CONTROL (rule: a test no mutation can break is not testing anything). TWENTY-ONE mutants, each a
// plausible way this could have been written, and each must be CAUGHT by at least one named check. M1 IS the defect
// class this change introduces — "a NOP header is overwritten without verifying the packet beneath it" — and M2 is
// the sketch taken literally (index dword 1017). M13-M17 are 0.0.413's: an address word not re-proven, Apple's
// address not re-pointed, DST_SEL not checked, the epoch dropped from the encoder, and a reset on the candidate.
// M18/M19 are 0.0.415's (Q4): the candidate site clearing/overwriting the committed record, and a promotion that runs
// at the gate before the keystone proves the frame. Both are exercised through the REAL candidate/promotion path
//, so the Q4 defect fails loudly instead of hiding behind a hand-set watch. M20/M21 are 0.0.418's: the E2 rule
// (`ks_eop_seen` = committed && ever, the flight ignored) and the E3 rule (REGION-MOVED drops the candidate but the
// frame still runs, pinning the next candidate at SLOT-PRE). E2 is driven through the same real flow in.
