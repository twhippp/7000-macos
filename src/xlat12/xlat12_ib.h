/* xlat12_ib - the IB-level driver around xlat12_translate.
 *
 * xlat12_translate works on runs of SET_* packets and refuses the memory-loaded class. A real
 * Apple IB also carries CONTEXT_CONTROL, COND_EXEC, sync packets (WRITE_DATA / RELEASE_MEM /
 * WAIT_REG_MEM / ACQUIRE_MEM / EVENT_WRITE), draws and dispatches. This layer walks a whole IB and:
 *   census     counts packets and registers by xlat12 class, flags the memory-loaded class,
 *              register operands in non-SET packets, nested IBs, DMA_DATA and unlisted opcodes;
 *   blank      (an INSTRUMENT) keeps only the packets proven on this silicon by milestone 1's blit IB
 *              and rewrites every other packet into one-dword NOPs (0xFFFF1000), SAME LENGTH;
 *   translate  translates SET_* packets with xlat12, passes the proven packets verbatim, recomputes
 *              COND_EXEC exec counts over their translated regions (rule 50), and refuses anything
 *              else - never passes an unlisted opcode or an untranslatable register operand through;
 *   pad        fills a translated IB to the original length with one-dword NOPs (in-place layout).
 * Plain C that also compiles as C++; no heap, no floating point, no libc.

 *     recipe for a passthrough VS: GE_MAX_OUTPUT_PER_SUBGROUP, RSRC4_GS, RSRC4_PS, SPI_SHADER_GS_OUT_CONFIG_PS,
 *     GE_CNTL), and overrides Apple's GE_CNTL writes with the same value;
 *   - NOPs Apple's shader-prefetch DMA_DATA (control 0x60200001: prefetch_parser, dst_nowhere) and the CONTEXT_CONTROL
 *     80000002/80000000 that the proven 80000000/80000000 form immediately follows;

 *   - sends everything else through the xlat12 table and refuses what it does not cover.
 * Layout is IN PLACE: the packets before the single draw shrink, NOP padding restores the draw's original dword index,
 * and the draw and the packets after it keep their offsets. `out` has room for n dwords; *out_len == n on success.

 * XLAT12_EXTRA_TABLE_DESC (refused with ERR_ARG otherwise - the mechanism has nothing to re-emit INTO without the
 * table step) AND a non-NULL `ex->ud_carry` (refused with ERR_ARG otherwise - F1: the translator keeps no mutable
 * state of its own to fall back on). ON, at a table-bound draw whose table pointer, texture index, sampler
 * index/class-11 pointer slot, OR declared PS/VS ABI pointer pair (item 3, F4: xlat12_abi_ptrs.h's rows,
 * MIB-A1-PATH.md B3's full set) was written by an EARLIER REGION of THIS SAME translation - today's
 * XLAT12_TDESC_SLOT_SHARED refusal, or an inherited ABI pointer - the translator re-emits a SET_SH_REG carrying
 * APPLE'S OWN recorded input value for that slot (the SAME raw gfx10 dword d_table_desc's own
 * SLOT_UNSEEN/SLOT_SHARED rungs would otherwise refuse against, from `ex->ud_carry`), through the SAME
 * d_reg/d_add path a live write takes, INSIDE THIS REGION - so this region owns its own write of the slot and
 * the SLOT_SHARED condition (ud_pos < region_from) no longer holds. A slot this region ALREADY wrote is left
 * alone: it always wins over the carry. This does NOT fix SLOT_UNSEEN (a slot never written anywhere in this
 * translation has no carried value at all) and it NEVER crosses a translation - `*ex->ud_carry` is zeroed at the
 * top of every xlat12_ib_translate_draw_ex call exactly as DPair's own ud_seen/ud_pos already are, on
 * CALLER-OWNED memory (F1), so two translations that pass separate `xlat12_ud_carry` structs never share a
 * value; a non-proven CONTEXT_CONTROL clears the whole carry (item 3, F4's B2 rule); a program using INLINE
 * descriptors instead of a table (ps_table_abi1 == 0) is untouched, so an inline record is never re-emitted.
 * Room shortfall in THIS region's own dword budget fails closed as XLAT12_IB_ERR_TOO_LONG, the SAME conversion
 * d_rings already uses, with no partial write (d_add either appends a whole packet or fails before writing
 * anything). build 0.0.453 item 4 (inv-f84/REPORT.txt): unlike d_rings (which stamps err_op 0xFF before
 * returning), a re-emission capacity failure used to leave err_op/err_in_dword exactly as d_region's LAST packet
 * left them - not this draw's own dword - because the failure happens AFTER d_region has already returned 0 for
 * this region. It now stamps XLAT12_REEMIT_NO_ROOM and err_in_dword = da[dk] (the draw itself), so the log blames
 * the draw whose re-emission ran out of room, not whatever register d_region's own pad walk last touched;
 * a shortfall in the table's OWN pad-run placement still fails closed as XLAT12_TDESC_NO_ROOM exactly
 * as it always did - re-emission can only SHRINK that room, never bypass the existing check for it. OFF, not one
 * output dword, counter or return code changes: the re-emission step is never reached and ud_reemit_n stays

/* build 0.0.454 items 1 and 2 (inv-f84/REPORT.txt "FIX T", seg 1;  item 3) - switch 48:
 * XLAT12_EXTRA_TABLE_REUSE - DEFAULT OFF; valid only together with XLAT12_EXTRA_TABLE_DESC (ERR_ARG otherwise).
 * Nothing in the kext sets it unless `accel gfxneuter 48 | 1 << 8` is thrown. OFF, not one output dword, counter or
 * return code changes. ON, two things change in the table step, and only there:
 * (a) THE PLACEMENT ALIGNMENT. The shadow table and its records are placed 16-byte aligned instead of 32. The records
 *     are read by the fragment program with s_load_b64 / s_load_b128 / s_load_b256 (the T#/S# then sit in SGPRs; an
 *     image instruction reads them from SGPRs, never from memory), and on gfx12 a scalar load needs only a DWORD-
 *     aligned address: Mesa's AMD NIR lowering gives every SMEM load `res.align = MIN2(4, bytes)` for all gfx levels
 *     ("Generally, require an alignment of 4.", re/graphics/src/mesa src/amd/common/nir/ac_nir_lower_mem_access_bit_sizes.c
 *     lower_mem_access_cb, the is_smem branch, loads up to 64 bytes), ACO's scalar global load asserts only
 *     `nir_intrinsic_align(instr) >= MIN2(bytes_needed, 4)` before emitting s_load_dwordx8/x4
 *     (src/amd/compiler/instruction_selection/aco_select_nir_intrinsics.cpp visit_load_global_smem), and RADV exposes
 *     VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer unconditionally with descriptorBufferOffsetAlignment = 4 (src/amd/vulkan/
 *     radv_physical_device.c), i.e. a set's T#s are fetched by s_load_b256 from a base that is only 4-byte aligned.
 *     16 is kept as a margin over that rule; it costs at most 3 dwords of pad where 32 cost up to 7 (F84 seg 1, AI's
 *     class-11 placement: 1 + 36 + 3 <= 43 with switch 49, where 1 + 36 + 7 did not fit).
 * (b) SHADOW REUSE. A fresh placement for a direct-sampler row (every row but class 11) sizes its T# and S# arrays to
 *     the spare dwords of its pad run (up to D_SH_TMAX / D_SH_SMAX records) and is remembered as the translation's
 *     reusable shadow. A LATER table draw of the SAME translation keeps that shadow instead of re-placing, when the
 *     table pair still holds the shadow's redirect (ud_pos == the redirect's position) and the row names the SAME
 *     table and sampler slots; each of its texture/sampler slots must either still hold the shadow's redirect or have
 *     been written in THIS region (a slot rewritten in an earlier region is not reused: the draw takes the fresh path
 *     and refuses exactly as before). New T#s (and the S#, when the sampler slot was rewritten in this region) are
 *     translated, sent through the SAME provenance ask as a fresh placement, and appended to the shadow's spare
 *     records; the in-region index is rewritten to the record's position. The draw's exports (in_tbl_va, in_img_va,
 *     in_samp_va, in_va/in_mode/in_proven, in_ptr/in_vptr) are filled with APPLE'S values exactly as a fresh
 *     placement would fill them. Under XLAT12_EXTRA_UD_REEMIT a reusing draw does not re-emit the slots the shadow
 *     still holds, nor an un-redirected declared PS ABI-pointer slot whose value this translation wrote in an earlier
 *     region and the carry still holds unchanged (that SGPR already carries Apple's value; the export names it).
 *     Refusals: no spare record left -> XLAT12_TDESC_NO_ROOM; a held record whose Apple bytes no longer translate to
 *     what was placed -> XLAT12_TDESC_UNSTABLE. Counted in table_reused / table_appended. */

 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES. found that F84's remaining table-draw declines (10 of 12 translated segments) are NOT
 * cross-segment: every one reads a VERTEX pointer slot (4 and/or 6) written EARLIER IN THE SAME translation, in an
 * earlier region - today unconditionally counted INHERITED (XLAT12_TDESC_SLOT_UNSEEN's sibling, "position <
 * region_from") because a later region cannot in general assume an earlier one's SGPR write still holds (a
 * REDIRECT of ours could sit there, or nothing at all if the earlier write was itself to a stale slot). ON, such a
 * slot is instead asked of d_vs_slot_known: 1 only when the carry (ex->ud_carry) still holds EXACTLY that write
 * for it (vs_ok bit set, vs_val[k] == out[pos[k]] - the identical "still true" test d_sh_abi_known already uses
 * for the PS case) - i.e. nothing has redirected or overwritten that SGPR since Apple's own last write to it. When
 * true, the slot is treated as known (its value is read and used, or the read-set names its page) exactly as a
 * slot written in THIS region already is; when false, it declines exactly as before. Applies in BOTH vertex
 * branches of d_table_desc (the declared-ABI-pointer loop and the read-set-row fallback) and in d_readset_stage's
 * OWN vertex call - the three places named. UNLIKE d_sh_abi_known's PS case, there is no "redirect of ours"
 * to exclude here: DTable's own redirect bookkeeping (`patched`/`ppos`) is PS-only (the table/texture/sampler
 * slots d_table_desc redirects are always PS SGPRs) - d_table_desc never redirects a VERTEX user-data slot, so a
 * vertex slot the carry still matches is, by construction, never one of our own redirects. Admitted slots are
 * counted in `vs_known_n`. OFF, not one output dword, counter or return code changes: d_vs_slot_known's flag check
 * fails first, so every site below evaluates to EXACTLY its pre-0.0.455 expression. */

 *                  (re-emission, table-slot SLOT_SHARED, d_sh_reuse_ok, the read-set's inherited rule) takes the

 *                  stream is not ahead of it (so the final trailer, and the fence828 packet in it, keep their offset).
 *   P3 DEFERRED    a fresh table placement is NOT put in a pad run: its records are built exactly as today into the

 *                  truncates), the redirect positions are remembered, and when the unit's stream is complete every
 *                  pending block is placed - first-fit in the unit's own leftover NOP runs, else first-fit in
 *                  `unit->pool` (free NOP runs of units the caller translated EARLIER in the same frame, any IB, each
 *                  journalled so the caller can undo them with xlat12_pool_undo) - and only then are the VA-dependent

 *                  redirects) written. No room anywhere refuses XLAT12_TDESC_NO_ROOM naming the draw that asked.
 *   C4 INVALIDATE  under XLAT12_EXTRA_DESC_INV the 8-dword ACQUIRE_MEM goes INLINE, in the stream right before the
 *                  unit's first table draw, unless XLAT12_EXTRA_DESC_INV_APPLE_HEAD and the unit's own head covers it
 *                  (the caller must set that flag only for a head that EXECUTES - gfx_mib.h n48_mib_head_executes).
 *   P4 UN-REDIRECT with XLAT12_EXTRA_UD_REEMIT, a later draw whose program can read a slot an earlier draw's table step
 *                  redirected gets Apple's carried value for that slot re-emitted in its own region (d_reg / d_add,
 *                  exactly as a live write) when the carry holds the slot; without the carry it refuses REDIRECTED as
 *                  it always did.
 *   HS PAIRS       every zero SPI_SHADER_PGM_LO/HI_HS pair write of the unit gets the ring-offsets pointer,
 *                  not only region 0's last one - so a unit patches what its constituents would each have patched.

 *                  with the PREVIOUS constituent's finished output slice (the kext's frame-local provenance feed).
 *   BLOCK GUARD    a later packet of the unit that rewrites a register the once-per-translation extra block (d_rings)

 * dispatch elided the target is never cleared at all.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES. Where 57 elides a PROVEN N dispatch (P1-P5, XLAT12_EXTRA_CS_ELIDE above), the NOP is replaced by a CP DMA_DATA
 * constant fill of ZERO over exactly [CB_COLOR0_BASE << 8, CB_COLOR0_DCC_BASE << 8) of the colour target N's DCC buffer belongs
 * to - only when ALL of these hold, else 57's NOP stands (counted in nc_ref_*):
 *   E1 the extent, from the window's own writes (the dispatch's end up to the next draw) at a packet boundary where P5's bind
 *      holds (CB_COLOR0_INFO DCC_ENABLE, CB_COLOR0_DCC_BASE == N's V# base >> 8): CB_COLOR0_BASE, CB_COLOR0_INFO,
 *      CB_COLOR0_ATTRIB, CB_COLOR0_VIEW, CB_COLOR0_ATTRIB2 and CB_COLOR0_ATTRIB3 all written in the window; CB_COLOR0_BASE_EXT
 *      and CB_COLOR0_DCC_BASE_EXT 0 or unwritten; ATTRIB 0 (one sample, one fragment), VIEW 0 (slice 0), ATTRIB2 MAX_MIP 0,
 *      ATTRIB3 MIP0_DEPTH 0, RESOURCE_TYPE 1 (2D) and COLOR_SW_MODE 27 (SW_64KB_R_X); FORMAT 10 (8_8_8_8, 4 bytes) or 12
 *      (16_16_16_16, 8 bytes); and the two derivations of the size AGREE: DCC_BASE - BASE == align(W, bw) * align(H, bh) * bpp
 *      with the 64 KiB block of that element size (128x128 at 4 bytes, 128x64 at 8). Every boundary that holds must name
 *      the same extent (else refused). All five targets satisfy it on run11v's captures (tests/gfx_nclear_test.cpp).
 *   E2 the room: the fill's packets replace the output of N's own contiguous compute-register run (the SET_SH_REG /
 *      SET_SH_REG_INDEX packets writing only [0xb800, 0xba00) that END at the dispatch, walked and re-checked in the output)
 *      plus the dispatch's own five dwords, and the fill's end never passes the dispatch's end in the INPUT (i + 5): the
 *      output never runs ahead of Apple's stream and the IB never grows. Measured on run11v: 73 dwords (10 packets).
 *   E3 the packets: ceil(size / XLAT12_NCLEAR_MAX_BYTES) DMA_DATA packets, 7 dwords each, XLAT12_NCLEAR_CTRL (ENGINE_SEL 0 =
 *      micro engine, DST_SEL 3 = dst_addr_using_l2, SRC_SEL 2 = data, CP_SYNC 1), data 0, src_hi 0, the destination, and
 *      COMMAND = BYTE_COUNT only (SAS/DAS memory, SAIC/DAIC increment, RAW_WAIT 0, DIS_WC 0). Encoding from AMD's own gfx12
 *      PM4 table (mesa src/amd/packets/cp_pm4_table_data_gfx12.json, DMA_DATA words 2-7); the per-packet cap from mesa's two
 *      drivers (radeonsi si_cp_dma.c and radv radv_cp_dma.c: `gfx_level >= GFX11 ? 32767`, aligned to SI_CPDMA_ALIGNMENT 32).
 *      DST_SEL 3 is what radeonsi's emitter writes on GFX12, where its comment says TC_L2 there means MALL - it does NOT make
 *      the write L2-coherent: mesa sets cp_sdma_ge_use_system_memory_scope and cp_dma_use_L2 = false for GFX12
 *      (ac_gpu_info.c), and radeonsi never CP-DMA-clears on gfx12 (0.0.535 review). CP_SYNC on every packet makes the micro
 *      engine wait for each fill to complete before the next packet; VISIBILITY to the colour pipe rests on APPLE's own
 *      barriers, so the fill is made only when both are in its input (E4 below).
 *   E4 (fix round (a)) the barriers: before N's compute run the end-of-pipe triplet (RELEASE_MEM 0x514 to a fence, a memory
 *      WAIT_REG_MEM equal on it), then only CS_PARTIAL_FLUSH, then an ACQUIRE_MEM with GCR_CNTL GL2_WB (bit 15) immediately
 *      before the run; after the dispatch, its next two packets CS_PARTIAL_FLUSH and an ACQUIRE_MEM with GL2_INV (bit 14),
 *      before the next draw (GCR_CNTL = ACQUIRE_MEM dword 7, mesa pkt3.json). Else 57's NOP (nc_ref_barrier).
 *   E5 (fix round (b)) at most XLAT12_NCLEAR_MAX fills per translation; a later proven N keeps 57's NOP (nc_ref_max).

 * unless `accel gfxneuter 92 | 1 << 8` is ON.
 *
 * WHY. Apple's rectangle draws (VGT_PRIMITIVE_TYPE 0x30908 = DI_PT_RECTLIST 17: WindowServer's Const_PS clears and Tex_PS LUT
 * draws, DRAW_INDEX_AUTO of 3 vertices) rasterize, on gfx11+ NGG, only with VGT_GS_OUT_PRIM_TYPE (uconfig 0x30998) = RECT_2D:
 * Mesa radeonsi si_pipe.h `sctx->gs_out_prim = sctx->gfx_level >= GFX11 ? V_030998_RECT_2D : V_028A6C_RECTLIST` and radv
 * radv_pipeline_graphics.h `case V_008958_DI_PT_RECTLIST: return is_ngg ? (gfx_level >= GFX11 ? V_030998_RECT_2D : ...`. The
 * translator writes the profile's TRISTRIP (2) for every Apple 0x28a6c write (d_reg), so the rectangle's third vertex is never
 * extrapolated and the clear never covers its target.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES. Decided at each DRAW (Apple writes 0x28a6c BEFORE 0x30908 in a segment, so the register write cannot decide):
 * the draw's VGT_PRIMITIVE_TYPE in force is the last one THIS translation wrote (PRIM_TYPE [5:0]); VGT_GS_OUT_PRIM_TYPE in force
 * is the last value this translation wrote to 0x30998 (d_reg's override of Apple's 0x28a6c, or this rule's own write).
 *   - RECTLIST draw, 0x30998 not already RECT_2D here: one SET_UCONFIG_REG 0x30998 = XLAT12_R2D_OUTPRIM (3) placed LAST in the
 *     draw's region (after the re-emission and the extra block, before the pad), i.e. immediately before the draw.
 *   - any other draw with RECT_2D (this translation's own write) in force: the same packet with the profile's own
 *     gs_out_prim_type (2, TRISTRIP). A non-RECTLIST draw with no VGT_GS_OUT_PRIM_TYPE of this translation in force is left
 *     as today: in run11y and run11v every non-RECTLIST draw after a RECTLIST draw follows an Apple 0x28a6c write in the same
 *     IB, and every IB whose first draw has no 0x28a6c before it opens with a RECTLIST draw (d_r2d_draw has the census).
 *   The packet takes 3 dwords of the region's own pad (the in-place contract: the IB never grows). No room, or ANY refusal of
 *   the flagged translation after it wrote, and xlat12_ib_translate_draw_ex translates the segment again WITHOUT the flag -
 *   today's output byte for byte - and counts it (r2d_noroom / r2d_fallback). The translation's own backstop
 *   (xlat12_ib_rect2d_check) runs over the flagged output. Refused (XLAT12_ERR_ARG) with XLAT12_EXTRA_APPLE_OUTPRIM or
 *   XLAT12_EXTRA_SYNTH_IDXPRIM: one register, two policies. OFF, not one output dword, counter or return code changes.

 *
 * WHY. Apple's barrier between a colour-target write and a later read of it is `EVENT_WRITE 0x16` + this ACQUIRE_MEM:
 *   C0065800 86287FC3 FFFFFFFF 000000FF 00000000 00000000 0000000A 0001C3F1
 * Word 1 is gfx10's CP_COHER_CNTL (bit 31 ENGINE_SEL micro_engine; gfx103.json names only CB_ACTION_ENA [25] and DB_ACTION_ENA
 * [26] in the low 31 bits). The 0x7fc3 bits are RESOLVED by the older register files (xhigh review, ; gfx6/7/8.json
 * CP_COHER_CNTL): the classic surface-sync destination enables DEST_BASE_0_ENA [0], DEST_BASE_1_ENA [1], CB0..CB7_DEST_BASE_ENA
 * [6..13], DB_DEST_BASE_ENA [14], DEST_BASE_2_ENA [19], DEST_BASE_3_ENA [21], with CB_ACTION_ENA [25], DB_ACTION_ENA [26] (0x86287FC3 =
 * those thirteen enables + the two actions + bit 31, which the gfx12 PM4 table reads as the packet's ENGINE_SEL and gfx8.json names
 * SH_SD_ACTION_ENA) - "every CB and DB surface, full range": exactly the CB + DB flush the conversion's event 0x14 performs. Kept as Apple wrote them in the verbatim copy, dropped by the conversion. CP_COHER_CNTL is ABSENT from gfx11.json and gfx12.json, and word 6's PWS_ENA (bit 31) is clear,
 * so on gfx12 the packet is a cache operation with NO WAIT for the colour writes before it (: the capsule's squares).
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES. In d_region's pass-through branch, an 8-dword ACQUIRE_MEM whose words 1-7 are exactly the above becomes, in
 * place, the two packets radeonsi and radv emit for such a barrier on gfx11+ (si_barrier.c gfx10_emit_barrier / radv_cs.c
 * gfx10_cs_emit_cache_flush: ac_emit_cp_release_mem_pws(cb_db_event, gcr & C_587_GLI_INV) then

 * DERIVATION A (built; the reviewer's decision after the builder's stop): Mesa's emit functions applied to APPLE's barrier as
 * written - CB_ACTION_ENA and DB_ACTION_ENA both, so the event is CACHE_FLUSH_AND_INV_TS_EVENT (0x14; gfx12.json VGT_EVENT_TYPE 20;
 * si_barrier.c picks it when CB and DB are both flushed), and Apple's GCR_CNTL 0x1C3F1 (pkt3.json GCR_CNTL: GLI_INV 1 [1:0],

 *   [31] = 80000000; word 8 gcr_cntl = only Apple's GLI_INV = 00000001). Stage CP_ME because Apple's ENGINE_SEL is micro_engine
 *   (no PFP_SYNC_ME).
 * DERIVATION B (NOT built): Mesa's own flags for a pure CB -> texture barrier (si_texture_barrier -> si_make_CB_shader_coherent:
 * on gfx12 only SYNC_AND_INV_CB | INV_VMEM) would give event FLUSH_AND_INV_CB_DATA_TS (0x2d) with GLV_INV | SEQ forward only:
 *   RELEASE_MEM  C0064900 8040452D 0 0 0 0 0 0      ACQUIRE_MEM  C0065800 00022800 FFFFFFFF 01FFFFFF 0 0 80000000 00000000
 * A is a strict superset of B (a TS wait for CB and DB, plus Apple's own GL2 / GLK / GLI operations): it keeps everything Apple's
 * barrier asked for and adds only the missing wait. Both use the TS counter with count 0 at CP_ME.
 * The pair is placed where the barrier was, so the release follows every draw before it and the acquire precedes every draw
 * after it. ROOM: 8 more dwords than the input, taken from the region's own pad before its draw (the IB never grows). The
 * conversion is made only in a region that ENDS AT A DRAW with at least 16 dwords left at the barrier; the region after the last
 * draw is never used (its trailer carries Apple's buried fence828 RELEASE_MEM, whose offset R1's fence identity requires to be
 * Apple's), and (fix round item 3) neither is a barrier with that buried packet later in its own region (a per-draw trailer: the pair
 * would move the packet 8 dwords off Apple's offset; counted `pws_fence`). No room: the barrier is copied verbatim and counted (`pws_noroom`), never refused. If the flagged translation is
 * refused after it converted (a later packet of the region no longer fits, or anything else), the translation runs again without
 * the conversion - today's output, byte for byte - with every barrier counted as no-room and `pws_fallback` 1 (never a refusal
 * this flag caused). The compute barriers (words 1 a8c40000 / 80c40000) and 86007fc0 are never touched (`pws_other`). OFF, not
 * one output dword, counter or return code changes. */
