# accel-run.sh — ONE Phase 4 accelerator measurement, captured whole, reduced to a
# ~30-line summary.  RUN ON THE PC (staged to ~/navi48-staging/accel-run.sh).

# Steps given on the command line REPLACE the default list; readiness and `fire`
# always run first because the accelerator does not attach until the TTL hook is
# installed. Default list = the HANDOFF section 5 cycle (since an earlier run; until then
# the default was the obsolete 0.0.177 logreset+kiqstamp sequence). The order is
# load-bearing:
#
#   synctables  Apple's GART PTEs into ours   gfxmap's PTE check refuses without it
#   setvspace   mem+0x98 -> 1  (gate 2)       MUST precede pm4powerup
#   pm4powerup  startKIQ stores the doorbell at ring+0xc0
#   kiqenable   ring+0xa8 -> 1                REFUSES on a NULL doorbell, hence after pm4powerup
#   gfxmap      software KIQ emulation        never with kiqstamp in the same boot

#   copyarm            accel pagecopy 1: arm the 0.0.201 residency copy for this boot
#                      (put it BEFORE blit, after the cycle; without it the skip stays)
#   shadercache        accel shadercache 1 (0.0.239, an earlier analysis): arm the hash-keyed
#                      substitution of gfx1201 code for Apple's GFX10 shaders at the residency
#                      copy - kernsub's seam with its one hard-coded kernel generalised to a keyed
#                      lookup in the embedded cache blob. PLACE IT BEFORE blit2start, not after:
#                      unlike kernsub it retains no Apple pointer and can only act while a copy
#                      runs, so arming it after the client has paged substitutes nothing (it says
#                      so in the log). shadercacheread reads the counters, shadercacheoff disarms.
#                      shadercacheadj (0.0.265, an earlier analysis) arms as mode 3: entries carrying
#                      register adjustments stop being refused. It applies NO register itself - the
#                      render path's per-identity profile does - so it is valid only for stages our
#                      draw policy translates. Needed for the vertex-relocation measurement, because
#                      SimpleTextureFragment carries adjustments and mode 1 refuses it
#   kernsub            accel kernsub 1 (0.0.204, an earlier analysis): substitute a gfx1201 blit
#                      kernel for Apple's Navi21 one at the residency copy's shader region
#                      (+0xfb00), guarded by an exact match on Apple's bytes. Put it AFTER
#                      blit2start (the copy must have run) and BEFORE the CP dispatches
#   kerndiag           accel kernsub 2 (0.0.206, an earlier analysis): substitute the DIAGNOSTIC
#                      kernel blit_diag_gfx1201 (INSTRUMENT: records {ttmp9,s8,v0,0x600d600d}
#                      and {ttmp7,ttmp8,v0,0x600d0b0b} into blit2's destination page, copies
#                      nothing). Same placement as kernsub; one kernel mode per boot

#   vmpage-<va>        accel vmpage <va> (0.0.206): the whole 4 KiB page behind <va> in Apple's

#   wslogstart-a       TEST A (0.0.268, an earlier analysis): as wslogstart, with the broader predicates -

#                      com.apple.SkyLight*, and kernel senders AMDRadeonX6000, IOAcceleratorFamily2,
#                      AppleGPUWrangler, IOGraphicsFamily
#   wskill             TEST A: console user must be root (checked in the step), then
#                      `launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.WindowServer` under a 20 s watchdog; records
#                      the kill epoch in .kill-epoch and the old/new WindowServer pid. FAILS without killing
#                      unless the console user is root. On an ARMED recipe (one carrying `armgate` or `commitarm`)
#                      it ALSO refuses unless the COMMIT arm's own read-back has confirmed, and it prints one
#                      `armwskill:` line giving the arm's wall clock, its own, and the gap in seconds
#   armgate[-<s>]      an earlier analysis: THE ARM GATE, and the ONE token an armed recipe must carry. Put it
#                      IMMEDIATELY BEFORE `wskill`, in place of the `sleep300` arm window (`armgate-300`). It
#                      declares "this run arms at COMMIT" and then WAITS (default 240 s, `<s>` overrides) for
#                      `gfx-commit: ARM LEVEL IS 2 (COMMIT); one-shot ARMED` to appear in driverlog-stream.txt -
#                      so the out-of-band arm batch DELAYS the kill instead of the kill outrunning the arm. It
#                      sends NOTHING to the kext: the stream is already running, so the gate costs no verb and
#                      adds no log line. NEEDS `logstream-start` earlier in the list (the only place that line is
#                      readable - `logstream` owns the ring, so `accel gfxneuter 4` prints only packed scalars,
#                      an earlier analysis). Returns the instant the arm is seen. On timeout, or with no stream, it
#                      sets LIVE_ABORT, which SKIPS `wskill` and every later client step: an unarmed window is a
#                      void measurement, not a result
#   commitarm          the arm IN the step list instead of out of band: read-only `accel gfxneuter 4` first (the
#                      pre-arm checklist must print CLEAN - the kext refuses a dirty world itself), console root,
#                      no abort of any kind, then `accel gfxneuter 260` (= `4 | 1 << 8`, the one-shot) and the
#                      read-back. Confirms the arm for `wskill` exactly as `armgate` does. Same placement: after
#                      the switch block and the fence switch, BEFORE `wskill`
#   sakill             TEST S (notes sections 486-487): console user must be root, then `kill -TERM` of the running
#                      SecurityAgent ONLY (WindowServer and loginwindow untouched); records the kill epoch and waits
#                      30 s for a new SecurityAgent pid. On an armed boot whose WindowServer started BEFORE fire it
#                      puts an ACCELERATED SecurityAgent under the SOFTWARE compositor. FAILS without killing

# CAPTURE DISCIPLINE (each rule paid for by a lost run):

#   - summary.txt is derived from the saved files afterwards, and prints MISSING
#     for any pattern that must exist but does not — an empty result is a claim
#     about the query until a positive control says otherwise.
#   - one measurement per boot: `fire` installs once, and the accelerator can be
#     left wedged. --force overrides; the transcript records that it was used.
#   - THE ARMED ORDERING, and the script now refuses a list that breaks it . The review's binding
#     order for the class-A instrument is unchanged and must stay in this relative order:
#         ... ringmap  gfxneuter-279 (switch 23)  ringmap  gfxneuter-1  gfxneuter-3  ...
#         ... <the switch block>  gfxneuter-14 (the fence switch)  gfxcapture-1  capstream-start
#         ... armgate-300        <- the arm block completes HERE, and the gate holds the kill until it has
#         ... wskill            <- the window opens at the kill, never before the arm
#         ... wscompose-<run>   <- the frames that are scored
#     Every pre-arm verb - the switches, `ringmap 1`, the gate read-backs, the fence switch, the arm and its
#     read-back - is before `armgate`; `armgate` is before `wskill`. The closing read-back block after the window
#     is untouched.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ THE ARM ----
# an earlier analysis (run `arm12`): the COMMIT arm landed 84 s AFTER `wskill`. The arm was thrown OUT OF BAND while the
# recipe sat in `sleep300`; the sleep expired with the operator's batch still running and the script marched straight
# on - arm12's own transcript reads `STEP 50 sleep300 END rc=0 ms=300004 04:04:02.190509000` then
# `STEP 51 wskill START 04:04:02.197976000`, EIGHT MILLISECONDS later. 731 of 896 gate attempts then happened at ARM
# LEVEL 1 (`gfx-commit:   not-armed 731 frame(s)` vs `not-translate 165`), `COMMITTED 0`, and the run's Q1 never ran.
# The invariant this machinery makes STRUCTURAL instead of positional: the arm is LIVE BEFORE THE KILL, and a slow
# batch DELAYS THE KILL rather than the kill outrunning the arm. It changes nothing about what is measured - same
# verbs, same read-first lines, same capstream-start/stop and irq-pre/post placement - and a recipe that carries
# neither `armgate` nor `commitarm` behaves exactly as it did before.
ARM_REQUIRED=0    # `armgate` / `commitarm` in the recipe: this run intends a COMMIT arm, so every WindowServer

  # That is not comparing like with like, and it is a false rate signal that would otherwise
  # steer the next decision. kern.boottime separates them and costs nothing.
  # TWO BUGS were caught here by testing this block against real output before the run, and
  # both would have corrupted the very signal it exists to fix. Recorded so neither returns:
  #
  #  1. The obvious parse `s/.*sec *= *([0-9]+).*/\1/` is WRONG. sysctl prints
  #     `{ sec = 1789410684, usec = 366110 } ...` and `.*sec` is greedy, so it matches through
  #     "u-sec" and captures the MICROSECONDS - 366110, not an epoch. Every report would then
  #     compare as newer than "boot", manufacturing exactly the false rate signal this removes.
  #     The pattern is therefore anchored on the literal brace, which "usec" cannot match.
  #  2. The zsh glob qualifier form `*.gpuRestart(N)` FAILED in testing ("no matches found"),
  #     and `zsh -n` still passes it because that checks syntax only. This uses find/stat/awk
  #     instead - no glob qualifiers, no shell options to depend on - and returns a clean 0
  #     when the directory holds nothing.
